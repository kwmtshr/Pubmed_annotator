We sought to determine the prevalence and predictors of vaccine uptake and refusal over 3 years among a long-term cohort of Chicago women with/without HIV (WWH/WWoH).
Research staff provided outreach and collected data on COVID-19 knowledge, vaccine intent, uptake, and refusal quarterly during 2020 and then semiannually through 2023. 146 women (102 WWH and 44 WWoH) participated.
Among 146 women, mean age was 54.4 years, 70% were WWH; predominantly Black (63%), unemployed (73%), 58% had ≤$18,000 annual household income, 63% had a high school education or less, and 65% had one or more comorbidities. Initially, 46% of women reported no intent to be vaccinated and were more likely to be employed, report medical mistrust and not living with HIV. By September 2023, 88% of women received at least one vaccination and 86% received the full series of doses. Vaccine uptake was lowest among those who were younger, less educated, heavier drinkers and marijuana users, and had fewer comorbidities including lower BMI and diabetes.
While initial vaccination non-intent was high, we observed higher-than-expected and more rapid COVID-19 vaccine uptake among vulnerable women of color engaged in a long-term research initiative relative to Chicago residents overall. Lower education, higher alcohol and marijuana use, and lower COVID morbidity and mortality risks were predictors of not receiving COVID vaccination.

Online ahead of print.,Reniers G,Trop Med Int Health,2025,2025/04/21,,,10.1111/tmi.14109,"In many low- and middle-income countries, perinatal mortality estimates are derived retrospectively from periodically conducted household surveys. Mobile phone surveys offer advantages in terms of cost and ease of implementation. However, their suitability for monitoring perinatal mortality has not been established.
We use data from the Malawi Rapid Mortality Mobile Phone Survey (RaMMPS) to estimate perinatal mortality rates from two versions of the survey instrument: a full pregnancy history and a shorter truncated pregnancy history. Female respondents of reproductive age were randomly allocated to either of these instruments. The sample was generated through random digit dialling with active strata monitoring. Post-stratification weighting was used to correct for sample selection bias, and estimates are reported with bootstrap confidence intervals. We estimated the stillbirth rate as the synthetic cohort probability of a foetal death with 28+ weeks of gestation over all pregnancies reaching the same gestational age. The perinatal and extended perinatal mortality rates were defined as the probabilities of dying between 28 weeks and 7 or 28 days of life, respectively. RaMMPS estimates are compared to the 2015-2016 Malawi Demographic and Health Survey and estimates published by the United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation.
Truncated and full pregnancy histories were administered for 2093 and 2067 women, respectively. Weighted point estimates of the stillbirth (19.81 deaths per 1000 pregnancies, 95%-confidence interval (CI): 14.11-25.62), perinatal (42.41, 95%-CI: 33.91-50.92), and extended perinatal mortality rates (50.11, 95%-CI: 41.56-58.84) from the full pregnancy history instrument are in line with Demographic and Health Survey and United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation estimates. In comparison, the mortality estimates from the truncated pregnancy history instrument are higher, but this difference only approaches statistical significance in the case of the stillbirth rate. Post-stratification weighting produces a small upwards adjustment in the estimates.
Mobile phone surveys are a promising method for collecting perinatal mortality data. The full pregnancy history instrument produces more plausible results than the shorter truncated pregnancy history questionnaire where the window of retrospection is restricted.",Mobile phone surveys offer cost-effective data collection methods.,Can mobile phone surveys accurately estimate perinatal mortality rates?,Used data from the Malawi Rapid Mortality Mobile Phone Survey to estimate perinatal mortality rates from full and truncated pregnancy history instruments.,Full pregnancy history instrument provided plausible mortality estimates comparable to established surveys.

The impact of diabetes type on DKA outcomes remains unclear. This study aims to compare mortality, length of stay (LOS), and hospital costs between patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T1DM vs. T2DM) hospitalized with DKA.
We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the 2016-2021 National Inpatient Sample (NIS) HCUP Database, focusing on patients admitted for acute care with a diagnosis of DKA. Patients were categorized into two cohorts: T1DM vs. T2DM. The primary endpoint was mortality, assessed using multiple logistic regression. Secondary endpoints included LOS and total hospital charges, analyzed using multiple linear regression, adjusting for potential confounders. Multiple imputations accounted for missing data, and a Bonferroni correction was applied for multiple comparisons.
The study included 1,244,184 patients, with 770,109 (62%) T1DM and 474,075 (38%) T2DM. Mortality was significantly higher in T2DM patients (0.91%) compared to T1DM patients (0.22%; P<0.001). LOS was longer for T2DM patients (average 3.92 days vs. 3.02 days for T1DM; P<0.001), as were hospital charges ($10,146.78 for T2DM vs. $7,811.98 for T1DM; P<0.001). Significant disparities were also observed in the demographic and hospital characteristics, including median household income, insurance type, and hospital region.
In this national retrospective cohort study, patients with T2DM and DKA had higher mortality rates, longer LOS, and higher healthcare costs than those with T1DM.

Despite advances in health care, there have been alarming increased in perinatal mortality rates in Mexico. This study investigated the influence of social determinants on perinatal death in a Latin American middle-income country, aiming to inform equitable and effective health policies.
A prospective cohort study was conducted with pregnant women from Mexico City. Data on the following clinical and social factors were collected: pregestational body mass index (pBMI), lupus, antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), preeclampsia, foetal growth restriction (FGR), social vulnerability, poverty, household overcrowding, and gender-based violence. Nested logistic regression models were developed to identify significant predictors of perinatal mortality, with the results reported as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
Among the 3,890 participants, there were 76 cases of perinatal mortality. Significant clinical predictors of perinatal mortality included higher pBMI (OR = 1.088, 95% CI 1.026-1.153), APS (OR = 10.049, 95% CI 1.843-54.803), and FGR (OR = 2.929, 95% CI 1.399-6.135), whereas high social vulnerability (OR = 5.332, 95% CI 2.485-11.443) and medium social vulnerability (OR = 3.084, 95% CI 1.528-6.222) emerged as significant social predictors of perinatal mortality. A comprehensive model incorporating both clinical and social determinants achieved an AUC of 0.921, with a detection rate of 67.1% and a false-positive rate of 10%, this indicating a significant improvement in perinatal mortality prediction. The inclusion of social determinants progressively enhanced predictive performance, underscoring their critical role in risk assessment.
Clinical and social determinants significantly influence perinatal mortality. Addressing social inequalities and integrating social determinants into perinatal care could improve maternal and neonatal health outcomes. However, limitations such as reliance on self-reported data, ecological-level indicators for social vulnerability, and potential constraints on generalizability should be considered. These findings emphasize the need for targeted health policies to reduce social vulnerabilities and enhance health care access in middle-income countries.",Social determinants impact perinatal mortality rates.,How do social determinants influence perinatal mortality in Mexico?,"Prospective cohort study in pregnant women from Mexico City, collecting data on clinical and social factors.","Higher pregestational BMI, APS, FGR, and social vulnerability were significant predictors of perinatal mortality.","Reliance on self-reported data, potential constraints on generalizability."

Online ahead of print.,Arroyo HM,Ann Vasc Surg,2025,2025/04/15,,,10.1016/j.avsg.2025.03.029,"Patients undergoing abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair face elevated mortality risk associated with advanced age and comorbidities including chronic kidney disease (CKD). CKD alone demonstrates an increased risk for mortality in patients. Our cohort study aimed to identify whether CKD and/or comorbid burden using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) are potential contributors towards negative outcomes in patients who underwent AAA repair.
We conducted a single-center retrospective cohort study on patients undergoing AAA repair between 2014-2024. The primary outcome is comorbidity burden (measured with CCI), and disease-specific burden (CKD measured by glomerular filtration rate (GFR)), as contributors to increased risk for mortality. Secondary outcomes included 30-day and mid-term complications and reinterventions after AAA repair. Propensity score matching was also conducted based on age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, smoking status, and coronary artery disease to assess for CKD and CCI burden.
A total of 212 matched patients underwent AAA repair, with 106 patients in the No-CKD (GFR ≥ 60 mL/min) group and 106 in the CKD (GFR < 60 mL/min) group. Sociodemographic variables, including age (No-CKD: 75.29 ± 8.17 vs. CKD: 75.94 ± 8.80; p=0.576), sex proportions (p=0.846), and mean household income (No-CKD: $99,199.08 ± 37,846.82 vs. CKD: $91,333.38 ± 32,128; p=0.091), were similar between groups. Patients with CKD had significantly higher CCI scores (No-CKD: 4.99 ± 1.96 vs. CKD: 6.11 ± 2.26; p<0.001). Thirty-day complications (No-CKD: 5.7% vs. CKD: 7.5%; p=0.580) and aortic-related reintervention rates (No-CKD: 13.2% vs. CKD: 12.3%; p=0.837) were comparable between groups. Mortality was significantly higher in the CKD group (No-CKD: 17.9% vs. CKD: 32.1%; p=0.017). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that stage 5 CKD (OR: 9.33, 95% CI: 1.26-97.09; p=0.04), CKD (OR: 2.16 95% CI: 1.15-4.17; p=0.018), and CCI score (OR: 1.42, 95% CI: 1.26-1.67; p < 0.001) are significantly associated with mortality.
Higher CCI and CKD stage are risk factors for a higher mortality rate in patients who underwent AAA repair. Subgroup analysis between CKD stages demonstrated that stage 5 has a stronger association with mortality than CCI.

This study evaluates how strongly socioeconomic factors associate with diagnostics, treatment, and survival among patients with HCC in Sweden.
All adult patients registered with a diagnosis of HCC in the Swedish quality register for liver cancer between 2011 and 2021 were included. Household income was classified as low (first quartile; poorest), medium (second or third quartile), or high (in fourth quartile; wealthiest) based on the overall distribution of household income across all household in Sweden. Outcomes included likelihood of diagnosis under surveillance, early-stage diagnosis (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer [BCLC] staging 0-A), and receipt of curative treatment (ablation, resection or liver transplantation), as well as mortality risk.
Among 5490 patients, a significant association was found between low household income and decreased likelihood of diagnosis while under surveillance (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0·63; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0·50-0·80), early-stage diagnosis (aOR 0·58; 95% CI: 0·51-0·67), and curative treatment receipt (aOR 0·65; 95% CI: 0·50-0·85). After adjustments for all variables in the BCLC, other sociodemographic variables, comorbidities, and cirrhosis status, patients with low household income had an adjusted hazard ratio for mortality of 1·29 (95% CI: 1·15-1·45) compared to patients with high household income.
Socioeconomic disparities associate markedly with more advanced stage at HCC diagnosis, less curative treatment, and poorer survival in Sweden. Addressing these disparities through targeted public health interventions may improve HCC care and outcomes in socioeconomically disadvantaged populations.

Patients were categorized into surgical and non-surgical cohorts. Propensity Score Matching (PSM) was applied to adjust for baseline differences, and survival outcomes were compared using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards models. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of surgery declination.
Of the 21,988 patients included, 363 (1.7%) were in the non-surgery group. Following a median follow-up of 33 months, patients in the non-surgical cohort demonstrated significantly lower overall survival (OS) compared to the surgical cohort, with mean OS of 17.8 months versus 45.8 months, respectively (P < 0.001).

Although household poverty is a known risk factor for adolescent mental health, evidence of the timing hypothesis is scarce. We aimed to examine the longitudinal associations of poverty across childhood with mental health in adolescence, focusing on the timing of exposure.
We used the data of 5,671 children from a Japanese population-based longitudinal cohort, which recruited the first graders (aged 6-7 years) and followed biannually until eighth grade (aged 13-14 years) in Adachi, Tokyo. Household poverty was defined as households having any of the following experiences: annual income less than Japanese yen 3 million, payment difficulties and material deprivations, measured in first, second, fourth, sixth and eighth grades. Adolescent mental health included parent-report internalizing and externalizing problems (the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire), self-report depression (the Patient Health Questionnaire-9) and self-esteem (the Japanese version Children's Perceived Competence Scale) in eighth grade. We applied g-estimation of structural nested mean modelling to account for time-varying confounders.
If adolescents were exposed to household poverty at any grade across childhood, on average, they would report more severe depressive symptoms (ψ = 0.32 [95% CI 0.13; 0.51]) and lower self-esteem (ψ = -0.41 [-0.62; -0.21]) in eighth grade. There were also average associations of household poverty at any grade with more internalizing (ψ = 0.19 [0.10; 0.29]) and externalizing problems (ψ = 0.10 [0.002; 0.19]). Although the associations between household poverty and mental health were stronger in younger ages (e.g., poverty in the second grade → depression: ψ = 0.54 [-0.12; 1.19] vs. poverty in the eighth grade → depression: ψ = -0.01 [-0.66; 0.64]), overlapping 95% CIs indicated no statistically significantly different associations by the timing of exposure.
We found the average effect of exposure to household poverty at any grade on mental health outcomes in eighth grade, failing to support the timing hypothesis. The findings indicate that the effects of household poverty accumulate over time in childhood and impact adolescent mental health (cumulative hypothesis) rather than the effects differ by the timing of exposure. While cumulative effects suggest a persistent intervention in poor households across childhood, we highlight intervention at any timing in childhood may be effective in alleviating adolescent mental health problems.",,,,,

Patients aged 60 years and older with histologically confirmed intracranial glioma were identified in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database. Initially, they were divided into a training set and a validation set in a 7:3 ratio. Next, univariate and multivariate logistic regression were employed to identify independent risk variables, which were used to develop a diagnostic nomogram further. Additional analyses were performed on the diagnostic nomogram's performance, including calibration curves, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA). A mortality risk classification system was ultimately developed using the diagnostic nomogram.
This study included 8,859 individuals diagnosed with primary intracranial glioma. The participants were randomly split into two groups: a training set consisting of 6203 individuals and a validation set consisting of 2,656 individuals, with a ratio of 7 to 3. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses on early death showed 7 independent risk variables (age, median household income, histological type, tumor grade, surgery, radiation therapy, and systemic therapy sequence with surgery) in the training set. A diagnostic nomogram for predicting the early death risk was created based on these variables. Calibration curves showed a high agreement between the expected and actual probabilities. The area under the curves (AUC) for the training and validation sets were 0.798 and 0.811, respectively. Meanwhile, the novel-created diagnostic nomogram had the highest AUC value compared to each independent risk variables, which showed that the nomogram had the best discriminatory ability. The DCA indicated that the nomogram has the potential to provide greater clinical advantages across a broad spectrum of threshold probabilities. Furthermore, a nomogram-based risk classification system was constructed to help us identify the high-risk population facing early death.
This study created a novel diagnostic nomogram to predict the probability of early death in older patients with intracranial glioma. In the meantime, a nomogram-based risk classification system was also constructed to help us identify the high-risk population facing early death in older patients with intracranial glioma and provide them with specialized care to increase their benefit from survival.",Biological age is associated with various diseases and mortality.,Can a diagnostic nomogram predict early death risk in older patients with intracranial glioma?,"Study on older patients with intracranial glioma, developing a diagnostic nomogram to predict early death risk.","Diagnostic nomogram accurately predicted early death risk, with socioeconomic factors influencing mortality.","Potential biases from retrospective data analysis, limited to SEER database."

A comprehensive and precise insight into a new range is needed.
Based on the ChinaHEART (Health Evaluation And risk Reduction through nationwide Teamwork), a nationwide, population-based cohort study, 4,485,773 participants living in 20,159 communities or villages were passively followed for death records, through a linkage of data with the National Mortality Surveillance System and Vital Registration. Firstly, we conducted Cox proportional-hazards regression models to assess the hazard ratios (HRs) of BMI on the risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality. Secondly, we used logistic regression models to examine associations between BMI and health-related quality of life (HRQL). Fully adjusted models were adjusted for age, sex, annual household income, occupation, education level, marriage, medical insurance, urbanity, tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption and the history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidaemia and cardiovascular disease (CVD).
Among the 4 485 773 included participants with an average age of 56.4 ± 10.0 years, 59.0% were female. During the follow-up period, which had a median duration of 5.3 years, a total of 142 004 cases of all-cause mortality were confirmed. After adjusting for participant characteristics and lifestyles, we observed the U-shaped association between BMI and all-cause mortality with an inflection of 26-27 kg/m
We found distinct ranges of BMI for minimized mortality risk and maximized HRQL. The BMI range corresponding to the HRQL is lower than the BMI range corresponding to the lowest risk of death generally. Therefore, it is worth considering how to define the new recommended range for a new BMI based on the goal of 'living a longer and healthier life'.",BMI is associated with mortality and quality of life.,"What is the relationship between BMI, socioeconomic factors, and mortality in a large Chinese population?","Study on a large Chinese population, examining the association between BMI, socioeconomic factors, and mortality.","U-shaped association between BMI and mortality, with distinct BMI ranges for minimized mortality risk and maximized quality of life.","Potential biases from retrospective data analysis, limited to Chinese population."

However, few studies have examined such associations in developing countries. Using data from China, this study aimed to examine associations of both serial absolute income drops and relative income trajectory and mortality.
We included 4757 participants from the China Health and Nutrition Survey, a large prospective cohort study. Data between 1989 and 1997 were used to define income drops and relative income trajectories. We defined income drop as a decrease of ≥50% between two consecutive interviews and defined relative income trajectory using a latent class model. All-cause mortality between 2000 and 2015 was ascertained by participants' family members.
A total of 2066 (43.43%) experienced 1 income drop and 477 (10.03%) experienced ≥2 income drops. A total of 535 deaths occurred (incidence rate 8.88 per 1000 person-years). Income drops were associated with a greater risk of mortality after adjusting for baseline income, comorbidities, sociodemographic and behavioural factors (HR 1.42 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.93) for ≥2 income drops vs no income drop). The downshift in relative income was also associated with increased mortality risk (HR 3.61 (95% CI 1.45 to 8.96) for always low; HR 3.36 (95% CI 1.36 to 8.32) for decreasing; HR 2.92 (95% CI 1.14 to 7.51) for increasing vs always high relative income). The associations between income drops and mortality were observed only among individuals with low wealth and low household income.

We examined a prospective relationship between transport-related walking and all-cause mortality among adults aged 70 years and over.
Community-dwelling, apparently healthy older adults (n=11 539; mean age 75.1 years, 53.1% females), participants of the ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly Longitudinal Study of Older Persons, reported their frequency of transport-related walking (never, rarely/once a week, more than once a week or every day). All-cause mortality was verified by two independent sources. Cox proportional-hazards models (HR and 95% CI) assessed the association between transport-related walking and all-cause mortality.
Of participants, 44.1% reported walking every day, 31.5% more than once a week, 21.7% rarely or once a week and 2.7% never engaged in transport-related walking. During the median follow-up of 8.6 years (IQR: 7.4-10.1), 1599 participants (13.9%) died. Compared with those who reported never walking for transport, the risk of all-cause mortality was lower for those walking rarely or once a week (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.96); more than once a week (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.99) and every day (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.96).

The Southern Community Cohort Study included participants aged 40 to 79 years recruited and enrolled (from March 2002 to September 2009) from community health centers by using random sampling methods across 12 states in the Southeastern US. Participants completed a follow-up survey between 2008 and 2013. Data analysis was performed from August 10 to November 30, 2023.
Sleep duration was self-reported at study enrollment and at 5-year follow-up. At each time point, sleep was categorized as short (<7 hours), healthy (7-9 hours), or long (>9 hours). Nine sleep trajectories were defined based on 5-year change or consistency in sleep duration category between enrollment and follow-up.
Cause of death was ascertained via linkage to the National Death Index through December 31, 2022. Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was performed to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for mortality outcomes (all-cause, CVD, cancer, and neurodegenerative disease) associated with sleep duration trajectory.
Participants included 46 928 adults (mean [SD] age, 53.0 [8.8] years; 65.4% women; 63.3% self-identified as Black and 36.7% as White; and 47.5% with a household income <$15 000 per year). Overall, 66.4% of participants had suboptimal 5-year sleep trajectories. Race varied across sleep trajectories; 53.0% of participants in the optimal trajectory were Black, compared with 84.5% in the long-short trajectory. During a median 12.6 (IQR, 11.3-13.1) years of follow-up, 13 579 deaths occurred (4135 from CVD, 3067 from cancer, and 544 from neurodegenerative diseases). Compared with the optimal sleep duration trajectory, suboptimal trajectories were associated with as much as 29% greater risk of all-cause mortality in fully-adjusted models. For all-cause and CVD-specific mortality, the long-long (HRs, 1.27 [95% CI, 1.14-1.41] and 1.22 [95% CI, 1.01-1.48], respectively) short-long (HRs, 1.29 [95% CI, 1.17-1.42] and 1.22 [95% CI, 1.03-1.45], respectively), and long-short (HRs, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.05-1.35] and 1.32 [95% CI, 1.07-1.63], respectively) trajectories were associated with the greatest risk. After adjustment for comorbid conditions, no associations were observed for mortality due to cancer or neurodegenerative disease. Observed associations varied by race and household income, with the greatest risk observed among White adults with greater household incomes.
In this cohort study of 46 928 US residents, nearly two-thirds of participants had suboptimal 5-year sleep duration trajectories.

This study analyzes recent trends in DLBCL including trends in hospitalization, inpatient mortality, and costs.
Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database from 2016 until 2020, a retrospective cohort study was performed to identify DLBCL hospitalization, discharges, and investigate outcomes. Trends were adjusted for age, sex, race, insurance type, mean household income, and hospital characteristics. Multivariable logistic regression has been used to analyze the data.
A total of 103,588,729 records were analyzed, identifying 47,425 cases with a diagnosis of DLBCL. From 2016 to 2020, hospitalizations have increased from 14,980 to 16,565. The mean age at diagnosis was 65 (P < 0.001). Males were slightly more affected than females (57.3 vs 42.6), with an increasing trend in males from 53.7% to 62.3% (P = 0.03). The highest prevalence was observed in the White population, followed by Hispanics and African Americans. Notably, the prevalence among Hispanics increased from 10 to 12%, while there is a decreasing trend in other demographics (P = 0.05). Medicare was the most common insurance, with increasing trends, followed by Medicaid and private insurance (P = 0.6). Inpatient mortality increased from 6.1 to 7.1 (2016 to 2018) and decreased to 6.1% (2018 to 2020) (P < 0.001). The mean length of the stay remained stable at 11.8 days.

However, the presence of racial and ethnic disparities in paediatric community-acquired pneumonia and the mechanisms underlying these disparities remain unclear. Motivated by disparities related to age and geography in paediatric sepsis, we evaluated the association between the joint exposure of race/ethnicity, age, and geographic region and mortality for community-acquired pneumonia to provide opportunities for assessment of future interventions that provide equitable healthcare. We hypothesized that geographic region and age would inform the association between race or ethnicity and mortality in community-acquired pneumonia.
This was a retrospective cohort study of children age < 18 years with community-acquired pneumonia hospitalized between 2016 and 2021 in the Public Health Information System (PHIS) database. Models included a priori stratification of age ≤ 1 year and geographic region. Racial and ethnic groups (White, Black, Hispanic/Latino, and Other), four geographic regions (Northeast, South, Midwest, or West), and two age categories (<1 and ≥1 year) were combined to create a joint exposure variable. Multivariable logistic regression, clustered by hospital and adjusting for sex, primary insurance payer, median household income quartile, urban identification, and the presence of a complex chronic condition(s), quantified the relationship between the joint exposure and all-cause mortality for paediatric community-acquired pneumonia.
Among 783,744 patients (median age 4 years [interquartile range 1-9 years], 45.9% female) with CAP, the overall mortality rate was 0.9%. Region and age strongly impacted mortality in all racial and ethnic groups, with higher mortality for Black, Hispanic/Latino, and Other patients <1 year. Among patients <1 year, Black patients in the South (OR 2.35, 95% CI 1.52-3.63, p < 0.001) and West (OR 2.47, 95% CI 1.35-4.49, p = 0.003) and Hispanic/Latino patients in the Northeast (OR 2.36, 95% CI 1.46-3.66, p = 0.031) had the highest mortality, relative to White patients <1 year in the Northeast.
We found evidence of racial and ethnic disparities in mortality for children diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia. Joint associations of race, ethnicity, age, and geographic region may partially inform potential mechanisms underlying these disparities.

This was a retrospective cohort study utilizing the National Inpatient Sample, the largest publicly available all-payer inpatient care database in the United States. We compared demographics, hospitalization characteristics, clinical outcomes, and year-to-year trends from 2016 to 2020 in Hispanic and NHW with a primary diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, or ulcerative colitis.
NHWs hospitalized with a primary diagnosis of IBD had significantly higher rates of hospitalization than Hispanics (122.67 vs 71.12, P < 0.01). While hospitalized Hispanics with IBD are more likely to be in the lowest quartile for household income (31.6% vs 19.3%, P < 0.01), have a younger median age (37.0 vs 45.0, P < 0.01), and be uninsured (4.3% vs 8.8%, P < 0.01) compared to NHW. Length of admission was similar, yet NHWs had higher rates of mortality (0.3% vs 0.2%, P = 0.01), while total charges for hospitalizations were significantly higher for Hispanic patients (P < 0.01).

Concurrently, researchers have identified that social determinants of health (SDOH) (employment status, family income and poverty ratio, food security, education level, access to healthcare services, health insurance, housing conditions, and marital status) are associated with the progression of many chronic diseases. However, there is a paucity of research examining the influence of SDOH on cancer incidence risk and the survival of cancer survivors. The aim of this study was to utilize SDOH as a primary predictive factor, integrated with machine learning models, to forecast both cancer risk and prognostic survival. This research is grounded in the SDOH data derived from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey dataset spanning 1999 to 2018. It employs methodologies including adaptive boosting, gradient boosting machine (GradientBoosting), random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting, light gradient boosting machine, support vector machine, and logistic regression to develop models for predicting cancer risk and prognostic survival. The hyperparameters of these models-specifically, the number of estimators (100-200), maximum tree depth (10), learning rate (0.01-0.2), and regularization parameters-were optimized through grid search and cross-validation, followed by performance evaluation. Shapley Additive exPlanations plots were generated to visualize the influence of each feature. RF was the best model for predicting cancer risk (area under the curve: 0.92, accuracy: 0.84). Age, non-Hispanic White, sex, and housing status were the 4 most important characteristics of the RF model. Age, gender, employment status, and household income/poverty ratio were the 4 most important features in the gradient boosting machine model. The predictive models developed in this study exhibited strong performance in estimating cancer incidence risk and survival time, identifying several factors that significantly influence both cancer incidence risk and survival, thereby providing new evidence for cancer management. Despite the promising findings, this study acknowledges certain limitations, including the omission of risk factors in the cancer survivor survival model and potential biases inherent in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey dataset.

Retrospective observational study.
Our cohort included children born in Utah during 1978-2008. Parental SES indicators including education, occupation, and area household income corresponding to maternal addresses were collected from birth certificates. Spearman rank correlation tests were used to determine the correlation between SES measures. Cox regression models and causal mediation analyses were used to assess the association between three childhood health outcomes-mortality, failure-to-thrive, and asthma- and three SES measures: highest education level and occupational status score of parent(s) and area household income.
819,108 children were included in the final analysis. We observed moderate agreement (r ranges 0.43-0.49) between individual-level SES measures (education and occupation) and weak agreement (r ranges 0.19-0.25) between these measures and neighborhood-level SES measures. Parental education had the strongest association with childhood health. The associations of parental occupation and area household income with childhood health, and their mediating effects on parental education, varied by the severity of health outcomes.
We introduced an approach to standardize SES measures from administrative records for longitudinal analyses. We confirmed that individual-level and neighborhood-level SES measures are distinct indicators of social standing and validated the importance of the choice of SES measures when analyzing childhood health.","Tea consumption has benefits, but its impact on chronic kidney disease (CKD) remains unclear.",What is the association between tea consumption and mortality in CKD patients?,Analysis of NHANES data on CKD patients.

PM2.5 exposure levels were estimated at the city level using the Community Multiscale Air Quality system. Mortality data were obtained from Statistics Korea. The study examined annual PM2.5 exposure by SES indicators and its confounding on mortality risks associated with PM2.5, using time-varying Cox proportional hazards models.
The study followed 1 453 036 individuals from 2007 to 2019, totalling 17 760 227 person-years (PYs). The non-accidental (A00-R99), cardiovascular (I00-I99) and respiratory (J00-J99) mortality rates per 1000 PY were 7.6, 1.9 and 0.8, respectively. We observed a trend of decreasing PM2.5 exposure levels but increased mortality among medical aid beneficiaries, those with lower household incomes and those residing in neighbourhoods with a higher area deprivation index. When adjusting for these SES covariates, the long-term mortality effects of PM2.5 shifted in the direction of increased risk [hazard ratio (HR) for cardiovascular mortality in the unadjusted model = 0.968 (95% CI: 0.909-0.959); HR in the fully adjusted model = 1.053 (95% CI: 1.004-1.105)].

To assess the impact of socio-economic status, we followed up with the discharged children until September 30, 2023, monitoring for all-cause mortality and unplanned readmission events. To evaluate the relationship between socio-economic status and prognosis, we assigned a composite score based on an assessment of household income, parental education level, and occupation. The Cox proportional hazards model and the Kaplan-Meier method were utilized for this analysis.

This cohort is defined as families consisting of parents and their children, of which at least one was born between 1990 and 1999 in Sweden, which totals 1 075 037 children. The children are linked to both (adoptive or biological) parents and their siblings, so the total number of individuals in the SWIFT90 yields a total sample of n=3 292 417. These families are followed through multiple national registers including information on income, education, inpatient care, mortality and criminal offences. SWIFT90 compiles administrative data spanning from 1960 to 2022, which reflects the most recent data available at the time of the data request.
SWIFT90 provides information on 61 982 parents (fathers=31 028; mothers=30 954) with children placed in OHC and their respective children (38,084). Several covariates could be assessed for the parental generation, therefore, providing a comprehensive picture of socioeconomic and health-related aspects of families with children born in the 1990s and placed in OHC in Sweden.
SWIFT90 will be used to investigate the socioeconomic and health trajectories of families involved with the child welfare system. With this cohort study ia possible to examine whether the inclusion of certain covariates alters the association between parental characteristics and child welfare outcomes. Future studies could also guide initiatives to prevent vulnerable circumstances among biological parents from escalating to the point where child placement into OHC becomes necessary.

Kyrgyzstan and India represent such nations that face a huge burden of CVD-related deaths globally. Understanding the prevalence of traditional cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs) in these populations is critical for effective prevention and management strategies.
This is a multicentric, observational study where we compared the prevalence of CVRFs in high-risk populations from Kyrgyzstan and India. Data was collected from established ASCVD patients attending cardio-metabolic clinics at tertiary care centers between December 2021 and December 2023. Demographic characteristics and CVRFs, which encompassed diabetes, hypertension, lipid profile parameters, tobacco consumption, etc., were assessed. Statistical analysis was performed to identify significant differences between the cohorts.
A total of 1552 individuals (772 from Kyrgyzstan, 750 from India) were studied. The Kyrgyzstan cohort had a significantly higher mean age and a greater proportion of females compared to the Indian cohort. The prevalence of tobacco consumption, hypertension, and diabetes was significantly higher in Kyrgyzstan than in India. Lipid profile analysis revealed greater level of LDL, HDL, and total cholesterol in the Kyrgyzstan cohort. Conversely, triglyceride levels were lower in Kyrgyz individuals. The Kyrgyzstan cohort also demonstrated better left ventricular systolic function compared to the Indian cohort.
Our study highlights significant differences in the prevalence of traditional CVRFs between high-risk populations in Kyrgyzstan and India. Higher rates of tobacco consumption, hypertension, and diabetes in Kyrgyzstan signify the immediate need for targeted interventions to address these modifiable risk factors.

Although prior literature has considered the effects of patient sex, race, and income, the contemporary impact of community socioeconomic disadvantage on outcomes after waitlisting for LT remains to be elucidated. We sought to evaluate the association of community-level socioeconomic deprivation with survival after waitlisting for LT.
All waitlisted candidates for isolated LT were identified using the 2005-2023 Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network. The previously validated Distressed Communities Index, representing poverty rate, median household income, unemployment, business growth, education level, and housing vacancies, was used to characterize community socioeconomic distress. Zip codes in the highest quintile were classified as the ""distressed"" cohort (others: ""nondistressed""). Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard models were applied to assess patient and graft survival. We performed a Fine and Gray competing risk regression to consider the impact of distress on waitlist mortality.
Of 169 601 patients, 95 020 (56%) underwent LT and 74 581 (44%) remained on the waitlist. Among transplanted patients, 18 774 (20%) were distressed. After adjustment, distressed faced similar posttransplant survival at 1 y but greater mortality hazard at 5 y (hazard ratio [HR], 1.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.12) and 10 y (HR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.05-1.12). Considering all waitlisted patients, competing risk analysis demonstrated distressed candidates to face significantly greater cumulative incidence of death/deterioration on the waitlist (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.04-1.11).

We aim to examine the impact of socioeconomic factors on outcomes including WLST in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH).
We conducted a retrospective study of a cohort of consecutive patients with aSAH who were admitted to an academic center from 2016 to 2023. Publicly available data on median neighborhood income by zip code areas were obtained from the US census. Low economic-insurance status (EIS) was defined as using Medicaid or having no insurance or living in a zip code within the lowest two quintiles of household income. High EIS was defined as not using Medicaid and having any other insurance and living in a zip code within the highest two quintiles of household income. The rest of the cohort who was not categorized in the high or low EIS groups was defined as middle EIS. We used multivariable logistic regression analysis to assess the association between socioeconomic and demographic factors and outcomes including WLST, mortality, and 3-month modified Rankin Scale.
We included 410 patients, with mean age 57.9 years (standard deviation 13.8), who were 65% female, 70% white, 36.8% low EIS, and 35.6% high EIS. Higher EIS was associated with WLST (odds ratio 1.53 per increase in EIS, 95% confidence interval 1.07-2.18; p = 0.02) when adjusted for other predictors. In addition, a higher quintile of neighborhood income, regardless of insurance status, was associated with higher odds of WLST (odds ratio 1.41 per each quintile increase, 95% confidence interval 1.07-1.86; p = 0.014). However, there was no association between EIS and 3-month modified Rankin Scale when adjusted for disease severity factors.

We aimed to examine prospective associations of OPA with CVD mortality using a large representative sample of adult workers in the United States (US), and explore how socioeconomic status (SES) may influence these associations.
This cohort study included US workers (≥ 18 years) participating in the 1988 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and passively followed until December 31, 2019. Time (minutes/week) on strenuous OPA (e.g., lifting, pushing, or pulling heavy objects) was assessed at baseline by a questionnaire and categorized into 4 groups [i.e., none, low, medium, and high]. CVD mortality was identified by International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Version (ICD-10) and collected by the National Death Index database. We examined the association of OPA with CVD mortality using multivariable Cox proportional hazard regressions, controlling for age, sex, race/ethnicity, marital status, education, annual household income, occupation type, and pre-existing cardiometabolic disorders.
In 28,604 participants (46.2% women; mean age 37.86 years), adjusted hazard ratios (95% CIs) of none, low, medium, and high OPA groups were 1.39 (1.01-1.91), 1.00 (reference), 1.18 (0.83-1.66) and 1.58 (1.12-2.22) for CVD mortality. The associations were stronger in workers with low education level (i.e., high school or less) [estimates of none, low, medium, and high OPA groups were 1.74 (1.09-2.78, P = 0.02), 1.00, 1.49 (0.92-2.42), and 1.87 (1.16-3.00)] or annual household income <$30,000 [estimates of OPA groups were 1.73 (1.16-2.56), 1.00, 1.29 (0.83-2.01), and 1.73 (1.14-2.65)].

We further explored the risk factors associated with these patterns and examined the relationships between the multimorbidity patterns and 11-year all-cause mortality risk, as well as health-related quality of life (HRQoL).
Using data from 18,101 individuals (aged 18-97 years) from the baseline Census 2012, Health Round 2013, and Verbal Autopsies 2012-2023 of the South East Asia Community Observatory (SEACO) health and demographic surveillance system, latent class analysis was performed on 13 chronic health conditions to identify statistically and clinically meaningful groups. Multinomial logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards regression models were conducted to investigate the adjusted association of multimorbidity patterns with the risk factors and mortality, respectively. HRQoL was analyzed by linear contrasts in conjunction with ANCOVA adjusted for baseline confounders.
Four distinct multimorbidity latent classes were identified: (1) relatively healthy (n = 10,640); (2) cardiometabolic diseases (n = 2428); (3) musculoskeletal, mobility and sensory disorders (n = 2391); and (4) complex multimorbidity (a group with more severe multimorbidity with combined profiles of classes 2 and 3) (n = 699). Significant variations in associations between socio-demographic characteristics and multimorbidity patterns were discovered, including age, sex, ethnicity, education level, marital status, household monthly income and employment status. The complex multimorbidity group had the lowest HRQoL across all domains compared to other groups (p < 0.001), including physical health, psychological, social relationships and environment. This group also exhibited the highest mortality risk over 11 years even after adjustment of confounders (age, sex, ethnicity, education and employment status), with a hazard of death of 1.83 (95% CI 1.44-2.33), followed by the cardiometabolic group (HR 1.42, 95% CI 1.18-1.70) and the musculoskeletal, mobility and sensory disorders group (HR 1.29, 95% CI 1.04-1.59).
Our study advances the understanding of the complexity of multimorbidity and its implications for health outcomes and healthcare delivery.

The National Cancer Database was queried for patients with stage IA-IIIA NSCLC who underwent upfront resection from 2017 to 2021. The primary outcome was time to surgery examined as a continuous and categorical variable in which patients were divided into timely (≤6 weeks) and delayed (>6 weeks) surgery cohorts.
Across 75,047 patients, the median time to surgery was 41 days (interquartile range, 19-64 days). Of these patients, 39,685 (52.9%) were in the timely cohort and 35,362 (47.1%) were in the delayed cohort. After risk adjustment, significant predictors of increased odds of delayed surgery included African-American race (odds ratio [OR], 1.46; 95% CI, 1.34-1.59), lack of insurance (OR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.33-2.17), lower educational status (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.04-1.25]), lower household income (OR, 1.40; 95% CI,1.28-1.54), and use of a robotic-assisted approach (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.15-1.27).

While incidence is uncommon, survival is relatively low with respect to acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), AML, lymphoma, ependymoma, glioblastoma, and Wilms Tumor. The pediatric renal cell carcinoma (pRCC) incidence, cumulative incidence (period prevalence), and mortality vary by health disparities' indicators, namely sex, race, ethnicity, age at tumor diagnosis, and social determinants of health (SDHs) as well as Epigenomic Determinants of Health (EDHs). However, studies are unavailable on some pRCC risk determinants, such as area of residence and socio-economic status (SES). The current study aimed at assessing the temporal trends, cumulative incidence, household median income, urbanity, mortality, and pRCC survival differentials.
A retrospective cohort design was utilized to examine the event-free survival of children (0-19) with RCC using the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Result Data, 1973-2015. While the time-dependent variable, namely survival months, was utilized, we assessed the predictors of pRCC survival, mainly sex, age at diagnosis, education, insurance status, income, and tumor grade, as prognostic factors. In examining the joint effect of area of residence and race, as an exposure function with time in survival, we utilized the Cox proportional hazard model, while the annual percent change was assessed using a generalized linear model, implying a weighted average.
Between 1973 and 2015, there were 174 cases of pRCC, of whom 49 experienced mortality (28.2%). The pRCC cumulative incidence tends to increase with advancing age. A significant survival differential was observed between black/AA children with RCC and their white counterparts. Compared with white children, black/AA children were almost three times as likely to die, hazard ratio (HR) = 2.90, 95% CI = 1.56-5.31, 
pRCC indicates an increased trend in males and age at diagnosis between 10 and 14, as well as a survival disadvantage among black/AA children, compared with their white counterparts.

Median household income (p = 0.344) and Rural-Urban Continuum (p = 0.100) were not significantly associated with improved survival rates when controlling for other demographics. Our findings align with previous research on sex-based survival disparities and racial variations in SCCE incidence and outcomes. Socioeconomic and biological factors contribute to these disparities, highlighting the need for tailored interventions and equitable healthcare access. Understanding demographic determinants in SCCE survival is crucial for personalized treatment and policy reforms to address disparities.

We evaluated the impact of income and geography on racial/ethnic disparities across the HCC care cascade in the United States.
Using NCI registry data spanning 2000 to 2020, adults with HCC were evaluated to determine race/ethnicity-specific differences in tumor stage at diagnosis, delays and gaps in treatment, and survival. Adjusted regression models evaluated predictors of HCC outcomes.
Among 112,389 adults with HCC, cohort characteristics were as follows: 49.8% non-Hispanic White (NHW), 12.0% African American(AA), 20.5% Hispanic, 16.5% Asian/Pacific Islander, and 1.1% American Indian/Alaska Native. Compared with NHW patients, AA patients had lower odds of localized-stage HCC at diagnosis [adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 0.84], lower odds of HCC treatment receipt (aOR, 0.77), greater odds of treatment delays (aOR, 1.12), and significantly greater risk of death [adjusted hazards ratio (aHR), 1.10]. Compared with NHW patients from large metro areas, AA patients from large metro areas had 8% higher mortality risk (aHR, 1.08), whereas AA patients from small-medium metro areas had 17% higher mortality risk (aHR, 1.17; all P < 0.05).
Among a population-based cohort of US adults with HCC, significant race/ethnicity-specific disparities across the HCC care continuum were observed. Lower household income and more rural geography among racial/ethnic minorities are also associated with disparities in HCC outcomes, particularly among AA patients.
Our study shows that lower income and less urban/more rural geography among racial/ethnic minorities are also associated with disparities in HCC outcomes, particularly among AA patients with HCC.

However, neighborhood exposures shift as communities undergo gentrification, a pattern of neighborhood change defined by increasing affluence (in wealth, education, and housing costs). Gentrification has inconsistent associations with infant health outcomes like IM, which may be due to differing relationships between its composite measures and such outcomes. We designed a retrospective cohort analysis of all births and deaths from 2010-2019 across 4 metropolitan areas in Michigan to determine how gentrification and its neighborhood-change components are associated with risk of IM, using multilevel multivariable logistic regression models. Among 672,432 infants, 0.52% died before 1 year. IM was not associated with gentrification overall. However, in unadjusted models, odds of IM were 40% and 15% lower for infants living in tracts in the top quartile increase in household income and college completion, respectively, compared to infants from tracts with the least amount of change. Odds of IM were conversely increased 29% in infants from tracts with the most increases in rent, though these differences were attenuated when adjusting for individual social factors.

Given its unique malignancy profile and rarity, there lacks a consensus on a standardized treatment protocol for EHE, particularly for hepatic epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (HEHE). This study aims to elucidate factors influencing the clinical prognosis of EHE by analyzing data from the SEER database, complemented with insights from a departmental cohort of 9 HEHE cases. Through this, we hope to shed light on potential clinical outcomes and therapeutic strategies for HEHE.
Using SEER data from 22 registries, we analyzed 313 liver cancer patients with ICD-O-3 9130 and 9133 histology. Twelve variables were examined using Cox regression and mlr3 machine learning. Significant variables were identified and compared. Clinical data, imaging characteristics, and treatment methods of nine patients from our cohort were also presented.
In univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses, Age, Sex, Year of diagnosis, Surgery of primary site, Chemotherapy, and Median household income were closely related to survival outcomes. Among the ten survival-related machine learning models, CoxPH, Flexible, Mboost, and Gamboost stood out based on Area Under the Curve(AUC), Decision Curve Analysis(DCA), and Calibration Curve Metrics. In the feature importance analysis of these four selected models, Age and Surgery of primary site were consistently identified as the most critical factors influencing prognosis. Additionally, the clinical data of nine patients from our cohort not only demonstrated unique imaging characteristics of HEHE but also underscored the importance of surgical intervention.

Lower emotional stability predicted increased coronary heart disease mortality (HR = 0.91, CI = 0.85-0.97). The association between conscientiousness and cardiovascular mortality did not differ between individuals with or without baseline cardiovascular conditions. In addition, adjustments for health behaviors and other covariates only slightly attenuated this association. Other personality traits were not associated with cardiovascular disease mortality.

Therefore, we aimed to assess factors associated with increased risk of suicide among patients with colorectal cancer.
This was a retrospective cohort analysis of consecutive patients with colorectal cancer. Patients who survived were compared with patients for whom suicide was registered as their cause of death. Data were extracted from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Research Database 2000-2020. Primary outcome was risk factors for suicide.
In total, 309,561 patients were included in the analysis; 160,095 (51.7%) were male. Suicide was the cause of death in 1,052 (0.34%). The suicide rate among patients with colorectal cancer decreased over time from 1% between 2000 and 2010 to 0.05% between 2011 and 2020 (P < .001). Male sex (odds ratio, 6.44; P < .001), non-Hispanic ethnicity (odds ratio, 2.84; P = .014), household income between $50,000 and $74,999 (odds ratio, 1.79; P = .008) or <$50,000 (odds ratio, 1.84; P = .030), and metastatic disease (odds ratio, 2.89; P = .001) were independent risk factors for suicide.

Neighbourhood income quintiles from Statistics Canada were used. Census household income quintiles were used to determine bias parameters and confirm results of the QBA. We calculated positive and negative predictive values using multinomial models, adjusting for age, sex and rural residence. Probabilistic QBA was conducted to explore the implication of exposure misclassification when estimating the effect of income on 5-year mortality.
We found poor agreement between neighbourhood and household income: positive predictive values ranged from 21% to 37%. The bias-adjusted risk of neighbourhood income on 5-year mortality was similar to the risk of mortality by household income. The bias-adjusted relative risk of the lowest income quintile compared with the highest was 1.42 [95% simulation interval (SI) 1.32-1.53] compared with 1.46 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.39-1.54] for household income and 1.18 (95% CI 1.12-1.24) for neighbourhood income.

Intrapartum-related events account for 24% of neonatal mortality. Of these events, intrapartum birth asphyxia with subsequent neonatal encephalopathy is the main cause of child disabilities in LMICs. Data on neurodevelopmental outcome and early risk factors are still missing in LMICs. This study aimed at investigating the factors associated with mortality, risk of neurodevelopmental impairment and adherence to follow-up among asphyxiated newborns in rural Tanzania.
This retrospective observational cohort study investigated mortality, neurodevelopmental risk and adherence to follow-up among asphyxiated newborns who were admitted to Tosamaganga Hospital (Tanzania) from January 2019 to June 2022. Neurodevelopmental impairment was assessed using standardized Hammersmith neurologic examination. Admission criteria were Apgar score < 7 at 5 min of life and birth weight > 1500 g. Babies with clinically visible congenital malformations were excluded. Comparisons between groups were performed using the Mann-Whitney test, the Chi-square test, and the Fisher test.
Mortality was 19.1% (57/298 newborns) and was associated with outborn (p < 0.0001), age at admission (p = 0.02), lower Apgar score at 5 min (p = 0.003), convulsions (p < 0.0001) and intravenous fluids (IV) (p = 0.003). Most patients (85.6%) were lost to follow-up after a median of 1 visit (IQR 0-2). Low adherence to follow-up was associated with female sex (p = 0.005). The risk of neurodevelopmental impairment at the last visit was associated with longer travel time between household and hospital (p = 0.03), female sex (p = 0.04), convulsions (p = 0.007), respiratory distress (p = 0.01), administration of IV fluids (p = 0.04), prolonged oxygen therapy (p = 0.004), prolonged hospital stay (p = 0.0007) and inappropriate growth during follow-up (p = 0.0002).
Our findings demonstrated that mortality among asphyxiated newborns in a rural hospital in Tanzania remains high. Additionally, distance from home to hospital and sex of the newborn correlated to higher risks of neurodevelopmental impairment.

We aimed to investigate mortality risk in individuals with diabetes living alone (IDLA) using a large-scale population-based database.
A total of 2,447,557 adults with type 2 diabetes were identified from the Korean National Health Information Database. One-person households were defined based on the number of registered family members. The risks of all-cause and cause-specific mortalities were estimated using a multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model.
During a median follow-up period of 6.0 years, 191,084 deaths (7.8 %) occurred. IDLA had a higher risk of mortality compared to those not living alone after adjusting for potential confounders (HR 1.20, 95 % CI: 1.18-1.22). This association was more prominent in younger individuals, men, and those with low income, and it was dependent on the duration of living alone. The risks of cause-specific mortality were all significantly higher in the IDLA group compared with the non-IDLA group. Adherence to favorable lifestyle behaviors was associated with a significant reduction in all-cause mortality, particularly in IDLA.

In this retrospective analysis of the National Inpatient Sample from 2000 to 2019, all CRC surgery patients between 50 and 64 y old were included. Patients were further stratified based on insurance type (commercial, Medicaid, and uninsured) as well as county-level MHI quartiles. Outcomes included nonelective surgery (primary outcome), inpatient mortality, complications, and blood transfusions. Multivariate logistic regression adjusted for sociodemographic variables, medical comorbidities, and hospital-level factors.
Of 108,606 patients, 80.5% of patients had commercial insurance, while 5.8% were uninsured. On multivariate analysis, Medicaid or no insurance, especially when living in a lower-income community, were associated with significantly higher odds of nonelective surgery (ORs: 1.11-4.54). There was a stepwise effect on nonelective surgery by insurance type (uninsured with lower odds than insured) and MHI (each lower quartile had higher odds). There were similar trends for inpatient blood transfusions, but there were no significant differences in mortality or complications.
Especially when considered together, noncommercial insurance and lower MHI were associated with worse outcomes in CRC patients. Insurance was more protective than MHI against worse outcomes.

These data were subjected to statistical analysis, which revealed that after the age of 50, there was a progressive increase in the risk of bladder cancer. Indigenous people had the lowest mortality rate, while white people had a significantly greater mortality rate than black and brown people. The North Region and Northeast Region presented the lowest mortality rates, whereas the South Region presented the highest mortality rates. In the South and Southeast Regions, a higher GDP was related to lower mortality. In the South, higher mortality was associated with a lower number of consultations per inhabitant per region. Fewer bladder punctures/aspirations and bladder biopsies were associated with higher mortality rates. In oncology, more procedures, such as total cystectomy, cystoenteroplasty, and total cystectomy with a single shunt, do not reduce the mortality rate.

India is a country with over 270 million active tobacco users. On the one hand, although the willingness to quit amongst tobacco users is as high as 55.4%, the actual quit rates translate to less than 20%. Taking a cue from the economic principle of commitment and consistency, paying a nominal fee can serve as a form of public commitment and motivation to decrease the dropout rate amongst those committed to quitting. This study uses contingent valuation assessment to determine the willingness to pay (WTP) values for an effective tobacco cessation service across individuals with different socio-demographic characteristics. A cross-sectional observational study with multistage cluster sampling in Rajasthan was conducted to recruit 360 active tobacco users from 8 districts. Q-Q plots were used to determine the non-parametric distribution, and statistical differences between median WTP values were compared using Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis H tests, considering a p-value less than 0.05 to be statistically significant. The majority of participants were males (57.78%) between the ages of 26 and 35 (40.28%), married (82.50%), and with children (65.83%), with an annual income between USD 7500-10,000 (23.61%) and graduate-level education (40.56%). Exclusive smokers formed the majority of the cohort (48.06%), and 50.83% were willing to quit as well as willing to pay for cessation. Median WTP values were maximum for males (USD 54.05; p<0.05), age group 26-35 years (USD 54.05; p<0.05), post-graduates (USD 81.08; p<0.05), and annual income above USD 20,000 (USD 121.62; p<0.05). Weak positive and significant correlations were observed between WTP and annual spending on tobacco, annual spending on health, and annual income. The study emphasizes the critical importance of early-age interventions for effective tobacco cessation prior to transitioning into dependency, resulting in reduced financial parity for availing health services. These are the first such WTP values from the Southeast Asian region, tailored for different population subsets, specifically for tobacco cessation.

The authors aimed to elucidate the association between SDoH and outcomes for a nationwide cohort of spine tumor surgery admissions.
The authors identified all admissions with a spine tumor diagnosis in the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) from 2002 to 2019. Four SDoH were analyzed: race and ethnicity, insurance, household income, and safety-net hospital (SNH) treatment. Hospitals in the top quartile of safety-net burden (in terms of percentage of patients receiving Medicaid or uninsured) were categorized as SNHs. Multivariable regression queried the association between 22 variables and 5 perioperative outcomes: mortality, discharge disposition, complications, length of stay (LOS), and hospitalization costs. Interaction term analysis with hospitalization year was used to assess longitudinal changes in outcome disparities. Finally, the authors constructed random forest machine learning models to assess the impact of SDoH variables on prognostic accuracy and to quantify the relative importance of predictors for disposition.
Of 6,593,392 total admissions with spine tumors, 219,380 (3.3%) underwent surgery. Non-White race (OR 0.80-0.91, p < 0.001) and nonprivate insurance (OR 0.76-0.83, p < 0.001) were associated with lower odds of receiving surgery. Among surgical admissions, presenting severity, including of myelopathy and plegia, was elevated among non-White, nonprivate insurance, and low-income admissions (all p < 0.001). Black race (OR 0.70, p < 0.001), Medicare (OR 0.70, p < 0.001), Medicaid (OR 0.90, p < 0.001), and lower income (OR 0.88-0.93, all p < 0.001) were associated with decreased odds of favorable discharge disposition. Increased LOS and costs were observed among non-White (+6%-10% in LOS and +5%-9% in costs, both p < 0.001) and Medicaid (+16% in LOS and +6% in costs, both p < 0.001) admissions. SNH treatment was also associated with higher mortality (OR 1.49, p < 0.001) and complication (OR 1.20, p < 0.001) rates. From 2002 to 2019, disposition improved annually for Medicaid patients (OR 1.03 per year, p = 0.022) but worsened for Black patients (OR 0.98 per year, p = 0.046). Random forest models identified household income as the most important predictor of discharge disposition.
For spine tumor admissions, SDoH predicted surgical intervention, presenting severity, and perioperative outcomes. Over 2 decades, disparities improved for Medicaid patients but worsened for Black patients. Finally, SDoH significantly improve prognostic accuracy for outcomes after spine tumor surgery.

All subjects were seen by an experienced dietitian the week before surgery. During this visit, patients had their sociodemographic and clinical data collected, as well as anthropometric measurements (weight and height) and BIA variables. In this study, postoperative overall 5-year survival was defined as the time in months between the date of surgery and the date of death, regardless of the cause of death. Patients were followed up after surgery until death.
Seventy-eight older adult patients were consecutively included. Patients had a median age of 65.5-years, were mostly men (83.3%), and most had low education levels (62.3%) and low household income, ranging from zero (19.2%) to the minimum wage (60.2%). They were mostly alcohol drinkers (91%) and tobacco smokers (87.2%). Glottic cancer was diagnosed in 48.7% of patients, with 44.8% of cases with stage-IV disease. Forty (51.2%) deaths were recorded in the follow-up period, with a median survival time of 39 months. Variables %MM, %BF, and SPhA were not significantly different between groups (alive vs. dead patients). PhA was considered an independent predictor of overall survival, with an accuracy of 69% (95% CI 0.57‒0.80).

The study sample included 15,735 participants who completed the questionnaire on pet ownership in 2018. The HILDA survey sample was matched to the National Death Index through 2022 to assess death during the follow-up period. Statistical analysis was weighted by the inverse of the propensity score in the generalized estimating equation. During the 4-year follow-up period, 377 of 15,735 (2.4%) participants died. The odds ratios (ORs) for all-cause mortality were 0.77 (95%CI: 0.59-0.99) for dog owners compared to non-pet owners after controlling for related socio-demographic, physical, psychological, and social factors.

We aimed to develop a nomogram to predict overall survival (OS) in rectal cancer patients who underwent TNT.
In retrospective cohort study, we extract the data of the rectal cancer patients from the SEER database between 2010 and 2015, including demographic information and tumor characteristics. The cohort was divided into training set and validation set based on a ratio of 7:3. Univariate logistic regression analysis was utilized for the comparison of variables in training set. Candidate variables with P < 0.1 in training set was entered into the best subset selection, LASSO regression and Boruta feature selection. Finally, the selected variables significantly associated with the 3-year, 5-year, and 8-year OS were used to build a nomogram, followed by validation using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, area under the curve (AUC), and calibration curve.
A total of 3265 rectal cancer patients (training set: 2285; test set: 980) were included in the present study.

This acute ischemic event demands swift and precise intervention to minimize myocardial damage and preserve cardiac function. Opioids, a class of potent analgesic medications, are frequently utilized in the management of STEMI-related chest pain. Despite their efficacy in alleviating discomfort, their use in this context warrants careful consideration due to potential adverse effects and interactions.  Methods: In this large nationwide retrospective observational study, we evaluated the effect of opioid dependence on inpatient mortality, length of hospitalization, and cost of hospitalization of patients with STEMI. Data was collected for 2019 from various hospitals across the United States using the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) through the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP). Using the International Classification of Diseases-10 codes (ICD-10), we identified a primary diagnosis of STEMI in patients over the age of 18, as well as a secondary diagnosis of opioid dependence.  Complex samples and multivariable logistic and linear regression models were used to determine the association of opioid dependence on inpatient mortality, length of hospitalization, and cost of hospitalization of patients with STEMI. Of the patients who fit our criteria, we identified other comorbidities and diagnoses associated with them as potential confounders including drug abuse, hypertension, diabetes, alcohol use, obesity, peripheral vascular disease, and chronic lung disease. Other confounders that were adjusted for include race, Charlson Comorbidity index, median household income, insurance, hospital region in the US, hospital bed size, and teaching status of the hospital.  Results: A total of 661,990 patients presented to a hospital with a primary diagnosis of STEMI in 2019. The majority of the patients were male with a mean age of 62.5+/-3.4 and were Caucasian American. Patients who were opioid dependent were found to be on average younger, earned less than the 25th percentile household income, had a higher history of illicit drug and alcohol use, and had Medicaid. They were also found to have higher rates of chronic lung disease at 39.2%, compared to 21.4.% in patients who were not opioid-dependent. Patients who were not opioid dependent were found to have higher rates of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Inpatient mortality and cost of hospitalization in STEMI patients with opioid dependence were not statistically different compared to those who were not opioid dependent. However, STEMI patients who were opioid dependent did have an associated longer length of hospitalization.  Conclusion: Opioid use for pain relief in acute coronary syndrome, particularly STEMI, is a mainstay of treatment. Our retrospective cohort dived into assessing the relationship between opioid dependence on its effect on inpatient mortality, length of stay, and cost of hospitalization in STEMI patients. Our study showed that opioid dependence has no significant impact on inpatient mortality. However, it was associated with a longer length of hospital stay in STEMI patients. Further studies may be warranted into the effects of opioid dependence on the length of hospitalization in STEMI patients. .",Opioids are commonly used for pain relief in STEMI.,"Evaluate the impact of opioid dependence on inpatient mortality, length of hospitalization, and cost in STEMI patients.","Retrospective observational study using NIS data, multivariable logistic and linear regression models.","Opioid dependence associated with longer length of hospital stay, no significant impact on inpatient mortality.","Retrospective design, potential confounding factors not fully addressed, limited to specific database and time frame."

The purpose of this study was to characterize patients and associated long-term clinical outcomes by OMT score-derived treatment groups.
CHAMP-HF (Change the Management of Patients with Heart Failure) included U.S. outpatients with chronic HFrEF receiving ≥1 GDMT. OMT subgroups were defined as suboptimal (score <3), acceptable (score = 3), and optimal (score ≥4) by baseline use and dose of GDMT, as proposed by the HF Collaboratory consortium. Cox proportional hazard analyses were used to assess for all-cause and cardiovascular death across subgroups, after adjusting for demographic and clinical covariates.
The authors studied 4,582 participants enrolled in CHAMP-HF with available 2-year follow-up. Median age was 68 years, 1,327 (29%) were women, and 2,842 (62%) were White, non-Hispanic. Median OMT score across the population was 4 (Q1-Q3: 2-5), and 1,628 (35%) had suboptimal, 665 (14%) had acceptable, and 2,289 (50%) had optimal therapy. Participants with optimal treatment were younger, had higher annual household income, and were enrolled from practices with dedicated HF clinics (all P < 0.001) than participants with acceptable or suboptimal treatment.

We conducted a retrospective study using data from the National Inpatient Sample database 2006 to 2018. We focused on Takotsubo cardiomyopathy hospitalizations, excluding those with acute coronary syndrome as the primary diagnosis. Two study groups consisted of White patients or Black patients. Univariate and multivariable logistic models evaluated race's effect on death, cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock, length of stay, while adjusting for potential confounders. The Bayesian model averaging technique was used to further elucidate the factors influencing death within each racial group. Significant differences were observed between the 2 racial groups. Black patients presented at a younger age, had a higher proportion of men, a higher burden of comorbidities, and a lower median household income compared with their White counterparts. In the univariate model, the Black cohort showed an increased risk of cardiac arrest (odds ratio, 1.45 [95% CI, 1.15-1.82]). However, the difference did not reach statistical significance in the multivariable model. Black patients also had a significantly longer hospital stay in both the univariate model (risk ratio, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.22-1.31]) and the multivariable model (risk ratio, 1.06 [95% CI, 1.04-1.07]). No significant difference in all-cause death was observed between the racial groups.
The outcome differences between 2 racial groups in our study are likely influenced by racial disparities in demographics, comorbidities, and socioeconomic factors. Individualized care based on racial group needs is crucial in clinical practice.",,,,,

We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the National Readmissions Database. Using International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes, we identified individuals >18 years of age who had a primary or secondary diagnosis of SLE and were hospitalized between January and June 2018. Using the validated claims-based Hospital Frailty Risk Score, we categorized individuals as frail (score ≥ 5) or nonfrail (score < 5) at the time of index hospitalization. Our primary outcome was readmission rates post discharge from index hospitalization. Secondary outcomes were rates of inpatient mortality and the total cost of hospitalizations. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the association between frailty and risk of readmissions, with adjustment for age, sex, insurance type, household income, and Elixhauser Comorbidity Index score.
A total of 39,738 patients with SLE met eligibility criteria. Over a median follow-up of eight months, frail patients with SLE (n = 18,385) had higher Elixhauser Comorbidity Index scores and longer length of stay compared to nonfrail patients with SLE (n = 21,353). Frail patients with SLE had higher readmission rates, a higher proportion of prolonged hospitalizations, and higher costs per hospitalization. Frailty was independently associated with a 10% higher risk of readmission after adjustment for covariates.
Among hospitalized adults with SLE, presence of frailty was associated with higher readmission and inpatient mortality rates.

Systematic reviews assessing various risk factors for different childhood injuries have been published previously. However, most of the related literature does not distinguish minor from severe or fatal injuries. This study aims to describe and summarize the current knowledge on the determinants of severe and fatal childhood unintentional injuries and to discuss the differences between risk factors for all injuries (including minor injuries) and severe and fatal injuries. The study also aims to quantify the reduction in childhood injuries associated with a reduction in exposure to some of the identified risk factors in the Canadian population.
A systematic review and meta-analysis will be conducted by searching MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Web of Science. Observational and experimental cohort studies assessing children and adolescents aged ≤ 19 years old and determinants of severe and fatal unintentional injury, such as personal behaviors, family and environmental characteristics, and socioeconomic and geographic context, will be eligible. The main outcome will be a composite of any severe or fatal unintentional injuries (including burns, drowning, transport-related injuries, and falls). Any severity measurement scale will be accepted as long as severe cases require at least one hospital admission. Two authors will independently screen for inclusion, extract data, and assess the quality of the data using the Cochrane ROBINS-E tool. Meta-analysis will be performed using random effects models. Subgroup analyses will examine age subgroups and high- vs low-income countries. Sensitivity analysis will be conducted after restricting analyses to studies with a low risk of bias. Attributable fractions will be computed to assess the burden of identified risk factors in the Canadian population.
Given the numerous determinants of childhood injuries and the challenges that may be involved in identifying which individuals should be prioritized for injury prevention efforts, this evidence may help to inform the identification of high-risk children and prevention interventions, considering the disproportionate consequences of severe and fatal injuries. This evidence may also help pediatric healthcare providers prioritize counseling messaging.

Moreover, associations between DNA methylation and low income or poverty status are evident beginning at birth, suggesting prenatal influences on offspring development. Recent evidence suggests neighborhood opportunities may protect against some of the health consequences of living in low income households. The goal of this study was to assess whether neighborhood opportunities moderate associations between household income (HI) and neonate developmental maturity as measured with DNA methylation.
Umbilical cord blood DNA methylation data was available in 198 mother-neonate pairs from the larger CANDLE cohort. Gestational age acceleration was calculated using an epigenetic clock designed for neonates. Prenatal HI and neighborhood opportunities measured with the Childhood Opportunity Index (COI) were regressed on gestational age acceleration controlling for sex, race, and cellular composition.
Higher HI was associated with higher gestational age acceleration (B = .145, t = 4.969, p = 1.56x10-6, 95% CI [.087, .202]).

Female neonates showed higher gestational age acceleration at birth compared to males. However, within males, being born into neighborhoods with higher social and economic opportunity was associated with higher gestational age acceleration.

In our study, for every decade age increased beyond 59 years, there was a significant increase in mortality; those aged 80+ years had 5.65 odds of mortality (95% CI: 5.32-6.00; P < 0.0001). Significant differences in patient characteristics were observed between patients who survived to discharge and those who did not, including older age (77.4 vs. 70.3 years; P < 0.0001), female sex (58% vs. 52%; P < 0.0001), and being transferred from another healthcare facility (17% vs. 10%; P < 0.0001). Patients admitted directly rather than through the emergency department were more likely to die (29% vs. 16%; P < 0.0001). The mortality rate was lower for blacks (OR: 0.75; P < 0.0001), Hispanics (OR: 0.91; P = 0.005), and Asians (OR: 0.89; P = 0.03), as compared to the white population, for females in comparison to males, and geographically, in all other areas (Midwest, South, and West) in contrast to the Northeast. Cerebellar stroke incidence and high mortality were seen in the traditional stroke belt. Mortality is also affected by the severity of the disease and increases with the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), All Patient Refined Diagnosis Related Groups (APR-DRG) scores, and indirectly by place of receiving care, length of stay (LOS), cost of stay, type of insurance, and emergency department admissions. LOS increased with age, in males in the Northeast, and was less in whites compared to other races. Trend analysis showed a decrease in LOS and costs from 2010 to 2015. Increased costs were seen in non-whites, males, higher household income based on zip code, being covered under Medicaid, transfers, CCI ≥ 5, and discharges in the western US. Median household income based on the patient's zip code was well-balanced between those who lived and those who died (P = 0.091). However, payers were not evenly distributed between the two groups (P < 0.0001 for the overall comparison). A higher proportion of discharges associated with in-hospital mortality were covered under Medicare (70% vs. 65% in the died vs. lived groups, respectively). Fewer discharges were associated with death if they were covered by commercial insurance or paid for out-of-pocket (15% vs. 19% for commercial insurance and 3% vs. 5% for out-of-pocket). In-hospital mortality was associated with a longer length of hospital stay (5.6 days vs. 4.5 days; P < 0.0001) and higher costs ($16,815 vs. $11,859; P < 0.0001). Variables that were significantly associated with lower total costs were older age, having commercial insurance, paying out-of-pocket or other payers, not being admitted through the emergency department, having a lower comorbidity index (CCI = 1-2), and being discharged from a hospital that was small- or medium-sized, located in the Midwest or South, and/or was non-teaching (rural or urban).",Cerebellar strokes have high morbidity and mortality.,Analyze outcomes following cerebellar stroke and their association with household income.,"Retrospective cohort study using NIS data, multivariable analyses.","Higher household income associated with lower mortality risk, disparities in outcomes based on income, geographic, and hospital factors.","Retrospective design, potential confounding factors not fully addressed, limited to specific database and time frame."

Based on UK Biobank (UKB) and China Kadoorie Biobank (CKB), we estimated the effects of four SES factors on transitions from baseline to CMM in situ, subsequently to invasive CMM and further CMM mortality by applying multistate models. We further explored to which extent the associations between SES and CMM incidence could be explained by potential mediators including sun exposure, lifestyle and ageing in UKB.
In multistate analyses, good household income was independently associated with an increased risk of CMM in situ (HR=1.38, 95% CI: 1.21 to 1.58) and invasive CMM (HR=1.34, 95% CI: 1.22 to 1.48) in UKB. These findings were partly validated in CKB. Especially in UKB, we observed an increased risk of CMM in situ and invasive CMM among participants with good type of house; only good education was independently associated with lower risk of evolving to invasive CMM among patients with CMM in situ (HR=0.69, 95% CI: 0.52 to 0.92); only good household income was independently associated with lower risk of CMM mortality among patients with CMM (HR=0.65, 95% CI: 0.45 to 0.95).

To evaluate the socioeconomic and demographic inequities in microsatellite instability (MSI) and KRAS biomarker testing among patients with mCRC and to explore the association of testing with overall survival (OS).
This cohort study, conducted between November 2022 and March 2024, included patients who were diagnosed with mCRC between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2017. The study obtained data from the National Cancer Database, a hospital-based cancer registry in the US. Patients with mCRC and available information on biomarker testing were included. Patients were classified based on whether they completed or did not complete MSI or KRAS tests.
Demographic and socioeconomic factors, such as age, race, ethnicity, educational level in area of residence, median household income, insurance type, area of residence, facility type, and facility location were evaluated.
The main outcomes were MSI and KRAS testing between the date of diagnosis and the date of first-course therapy. Univariable and multivariable logistic regressions were used to identify the relevant factors in MSI and KRAS testing. The OS outcomes were also evaluated.
Among the 41 061 patients included (22 362 males [54.5%]; mean [SD] age, 62.3 [10.1] years; 17.3% identified as Black individuals, 78.0% as White individuals, 4.7% as individuals of other race, with 6.5% Hispanic or 93.5% non-Hispanic ethnicity), 28.8% underwent KRAS testing and 43.7% received MSI testing. A significant proportion of patients had Medicare insurance (43.6%), received treatment at a comprehensive community cancer program (40.5%), and lived in an area with lower educational level (51.3%). Factors associated with a lower likelihood of MSI testing included age of 70 to 79 years (relative risk [RR], 0.70; 95% CI, 0.66-0.74; P < .001), treatment at a community cancer program (RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.70-0.79; P < .001), rural residency (RR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.69-0.92; P < .001), lower educational level in area of residence (RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.79-0.89; P < .001), and treatment at East South Central facilities (RR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.61-0.73; P < .001). Similar patterns were observed for KRAS testing. Survival analysis showed modest OS improvement in patients with MSI testing (hazard ratio, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.91-0.96; P < .001). The median (IQR) follow-up time for the survival analysis was 13.96 (3.71-29.34) months.

Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) are increasingly recognized as significant contributors to patients' disease management and health outcomes. Our academic center has validated a 10-item SDoH screener, and we elucidated which specific needs may be predictive of delayed TTI.
This is a retrospective cohort study at an urban academic center of patients with a SDoH screening and diagnosis of breast, colorectal, endocrine/neuroendocrine, GI, genitourinary, gynecologic, head and neck, hematologic, hepatobiliary, lung, or pancreatic cancer from 2018 to 2022. Variables of interest included household income, tumor stage, and emergency department (ED) or inpatient admission 30 days before diagnosis. Factors associated with delayed TTI ≥45 days were assessed using multivariable logistic regression.
Among 2,328 patients (mean [standard deviation] age, 64.0 (12.8) years; 66.6% female), having >1 unmet social need was associated with delayed TTI (odds ratio [OR], 1.68; 95% CI, 1.54 to 1.82). The disparities most associated with delay were legal help, transportation, housing stability, and needing to provide care for others.

The cohort of incident gastric cancer diagnosed between 2002 and 2015 was studied with active follow-up with household visits. The regional gastric cancer registry was primary for case identification, with completeness examination with hospital data and national death certificates. Cox regression models were used for survival calculations.
Survival follow-up was achieved in 741/774 patients (95.7%). Household interviews were conducted in 74.1% (n = 549); 65.7% were male, median age at diagnosis was 64 years, 24.5% were <55 years; 43.9% of tumors had pyloric obstruction; 45.2%, 43.2%, and 7.3% of histology was intestinal, diffuse, and mixed, respectively. A total of 24.7% patients received treatment. The 5-year survival rates were 9.9% for both males and females, 7.7% for age <45, and 7.9% for diffuse gastric cancer. Median survival time was 4.8 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 4.2-5.6].

The hypothesis is that for most aspects of the network, friends lose ""importance"" as people become older, with neighbors gradually becoming more dominant in the nonkin network.
Data are used for people aged 55-90 between 1999 and 2019 from the Swiss Household Panel (N = 5,585). A total of 4 network aspects were measured: size, contact, practical support, and emotional support. Measures for neighbors and friends were compared and analyzed with fixed-effects and hybrid-effects regression models on person-year observations.
The sizes of both network segments declined with age but more strongly for friends than neighbors. Contact with friends was stable but contact with neighbors increased. Support from friends declined whereas support from neighbors was stable. Direct comparisons revealed that the relative share of neighbors vis-à-vis friends increased as people age. Friends were more common and supportive vis-à-vis neighbors for divorced and widowed people than for married people, but this gap declined with age. The share of neighbors increased with retirement, especially for men. The share of neighbors vis-à-vis friends was also larger for people with less income and education and this gap did not change with age.
In the nonkin part of older adults' networks, proximity eventually becomes dominant. This finding is interpreted in terms of rising needs, greater opportunity for local contact, and friend mortality risks, all favoring the neighbor segment of the network.","Social networks change with age, with neighbors becoming more dominant over friends.","How do the roles of neighbors and friends in social networks change with age and are influenced by cohort, marriage, employment, and socioeconomic status?",Data analysis from the Swiss Household Panel for people aged 55-90 between 1999-2019.

Data from 2997 patients diagnosed with AA between 2004 and 2015 were retrospectively extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. The Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator and multivariate Cox regression analyses were applied to select factors and establish prognostic nomograms. The discriminatory ability of these nomogram models was evaluated using the concordance index and receiver operating characteristic curve. Risk stratifications were established based on the nomograms.
Selected 2997 AA patients were distributed into the training cohort (70%, 2097) and the validation cohort (30%, 900). Age, household income, tumor site, extension, surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy were identified as independent prognostic factors for both overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS).

While socioeconomic status is known to influence health-care outcomes, its specific association with TAAD remains underexplored. This study aimed to investigate the population-based association between socioeconomic status with TAAD repair outcomes using a national registry.
Patients who had TAAD repair were identified in National Inpatient Sample from Q4 2015-2020. National Inpatient Sample stratified estimated median household income of residents within a patient's ZIP code. Patients residing in neighborhoods of incomes in the lowest and highest quartiles were selected as the study cohorts. Multivariable logistic regressions were used to compare in-hospital outcomes, adjusted for demographics, comorbid conditions, hospital characteristics, primary payer status, and transfer status.
Compared to patients from high-income neighborhoods, patients in low-income communities had higher risks of mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.45, P = 0.01), acute kidney injury (aOR 1.225, P = 0.03), and infection (aOR 1.474, P = 0.02), as well as longer wait from admission to operation (24.96 ± 2.64 versus 18.00 ± 1.92 h, P = 0.03) and longer length of stay (15.06 ± 0.38 versus 13.80 ± 0.36 d, P = 0.01).

Among 2925 adults (1704 [58.3%] female; mean [SD] age, 41.9 [15.9] years), the prevalence of hypertension was 32.8% (95% CI, 31.1%-34.5%) and the prevalence of CVD was 14.7% (95% CI, 13.5%-16.0%). Hypertension prevalence ranged from 26.2% (95% CI, 23.1%-29.3%) to 38.4% (95% CI, 34.8%-42.0%) between quartiles 1 and 4, while CVD prevalence ranged from 11.1% (95% CI, 8.8%-13.3%) to 19.7% (95% CI, 16.8%-22.6%). SVI-H quartile 4 vs 1 was associated with a greater prevalence of hypertension (PR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.02-1.34) and CVD (PR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.16-1.89). Among CVD subtypes, SVI-H was significantly associated with HF (PR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.23-2.18) but not with combined stroke and TIA or combined angina and MI.

Secondary analysis of the Life After Pediatric Sepsis Evaluation (LAPSE) prospective cohort study was conducted between 2014 and 2017.
Twelve academic U.S. PICUs were involved in the study.
Children younger than 18 years with community-acquired septic shock were involved in the study.

We assessed associations between race, ethnicity, income, education, marital status, insurance, language, and home U.S. postal code with day 28 mortality, new functional morbidity at discharge per day 28, and HRQL decline using logistic regression. Of 389 patients, 32% ( n = 98) of families had household income less than $50,000 per year. Median Pediatric Risk of Mortality (PRISM) score was 11 (interquartile range 6, 17). We found that English language and Area Deprivation Index less than 50th percentile were associated with higher PRISM scores. Mortality was 6.7% ( n = 26), new functional morbidity occurred in 21.8% ( n = 78) of patients, and HRQL decline by greater than 10% occurred in 31.0% of patients ( n = 63). We failed to identify any association between SDOH measures and mortality, new functional morbidity, or HRQL decline.

The objective of this cohort study was to examine the epidemiological characteristics of ACO, explore the association between ACO and all-cause mortality, and investigate the potential mediating role of depressive symptoms in this association.
This retrospective cohort study used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005-2018 and National Death Index (NDI) 2019. A total of 22,745 participants were included: 705 with ACO, 2352 with asthma-only, 853 with COPD-only, and 18,835 without asthma or COPD. The non-ACO group (N = 22,040) referred to the individuals without ACO. Statistical tests were employed to assess differences in some characteristics between the ACO group and the other groups. Cox proportional hazards models were applied to evaluate the relationship between ACO and all-cause mortality, estimating hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals. Mediation analysis was conducted to investigate the potential mediating effects of depressive symptoms on the association of ACO with all-cause mortality.
The prevalence of ACO was 3.10% in our study population. Compared to the non-ACO participants, the ACO participants exhibited significantly different characteristics, including higher age, a lower family income-to-poverty ratio, a higher body mass index, higher rates of comorbidities i.e., hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular disease, and cancer, poorer dietary habits, and a higher rate of depressive disorders. Compared to the participants without ACO, the participants with ACO exhibited a significant increase in all-cause mortality (HR = 1.908, 95%CI 1.578-1.307, p < 0.001). The proportions mediated by depressive symptoms for ACO -associated all-cause mortality were 8.13% (CI: 4.22%-14.00%, p < 0.001).
This study revealed a strong relationship between ACO and all-cause mortality and uncovered a potential psychological mechanism underlying this relationship.

To explore the association between social isolation and mortality due to all causes, cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and malignant neoplasms focusing on heterogeneity by sociodemographic factors.
This cohort study used a moderator-wide approach to examine the heterogeneity in the association of social isolation with all-cause, CVD, and malignant neoplasm mortality using baseline data from the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study in 2010 and 2011. Eligible participants were adults aged 65 years or older without heart disease, stroke, cancer, or impaired activity of daily living across 12 Japanese municipalities. Follow-up continued until December 31, 2017, identifying 6-year all-cause, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and malignant neoplasm mortality. Logistic regression assessed effect modification by age, gender, education, income, population density, marital status, and employment on mortality associations. Data analysis was performed from September 13, 2023, to March 17, 2024.
Social isolation, determined by a 3-item scale (scores of 2 or 3 indicating isolation) was the primary exposure variable.

This study included 37 604 older adults, with a mean (SD) age of 73.5 (5.9) years (21 073 women [56.0%]). A total of 10 094 participants (26.8%) were classified as experiencing social isolation. Social isolation was associated with increased all-cause (odds ratio [OR], 1.20 [95% CI, 1.09-1.32]), CVD (OR, 1.22 [95% CI, 0.98-1.52]), and malignant neoplasm mortality (OR, 1.14 [95% CI, 1.01-1.28]). Stratified analysis showed associations of social isolation with all-cause and malignant neoplasm mortality among people with high income (highest tertile all cause: OR, 1.27 [95% CI, 1.06-1.53]; malignant neoplasm: OR, 1.27 [95% CI, 1.02-1.60]), living in areas with high population density (highest tertile all cause: OR, 1.47 [95% CI, 1.26-1.72]; malignant neoplasm: OR, 1.38 [95% CI, 1.11-1.70]), not married (all cause: OR, 1.33 [95% CI, 1.15-1.53]; malignant neoplasm: OR, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.02-1.52]), and retirees (all cause: OR, 1.27 [95% CI, 1.14-1.43]; malignant neoplasm: OR, 1.27 [95% CI, 1.10-1.48]). Formal testing for effect modification indicated modification by population density and employment for all-cause mortality and by household income and employment for neoplasm mortality.

We performed a single institution, mixed methods, cross-sectional study of patients who had a LDCT ordered from July to December 2022. We then completed phone surveys with patients who did not complete LDCT to assess knowledge, attitude, and perceptions toward LCS.
We identified 380 patients who met inclusion criteria, including 331 (87%) who completed LDCT and 49 (13%) who did not. Patients who completed a LDCT and those who did not were similar regarding age, sex, race, primary language, household income, body mass index, median pack years, and quit time. Positive predictors of LDCT completion were: meeting USPSTF guidelines (97.9% vs 81.6%), being married (58.3% vs 44.9%), former versus current smokers (55% vs 41.7%), personal history of emphysema (60.4% vs 42.9%), and family history of lung cancer (13.9% vs 4.1%) (all P < .05). Of the patients who participated in the phone survey, only 7% of respondents thought they were high risk for developing lung cancer despite attending a shared decision-making visit and only 10% wanted to re-schedule their LDCT.
There exist barriers to completing LDCT even after patients are identified as eligible and complete a shared decision-making visit secondary to knowledge barriers, misperceptions, and patient disinterest.",,,,,

This retrospective cross-sectional study used data for patients with breast cancer from the 2004 to 2020 National Cancer Database. Four treatment modalities were assessed: chemotherapy, hormone therapy (HT), radiotherapy, and surgery. The chemotherapy cohort included patients with stage I to IV disease. The HT cohort included patients with stage I to IV hormone receptor-positive disease. The radiotherapy and surgery cohorts included patients with stage I to III disease. Data were analyzed from March to November 2023.
Race and ethnicity and other sociodemographic and clinicopathologic characteristics.
Treatment decision, categorized as received or declined, was modeled using logistic regression. OS was modeled using Cox regression. Models were controlled for year of initial diagnosis, age, sex, health insurance, median household income, facility type, Charlson-Deyo comorbidity score, histology, American Joint Committee on Cancer stage, molecular subtype, and tumor grade.
The study included 2 837 446 patients (mean [SD] age, 61.6 [13.4] years; 99.1% female), with 1.7% American Indian, Alaska Native, or other patients; 3.5% Asian or Pacific Islander patients; 11.2% Black patients; 5.6% Hispanic patients; and 78.0% White patients.

Whether there is a relationship between lipid parameters, specifically apolipoprotein B (apoB), apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1), their ratio (apoB/apoA1), and SDoH, and whether coronary artery disease (CAD) mortality risk associated with circulating apoB and apoA1 is modified by SDoH was unclear.
We investigated associations of apoA1, apoB, and apoB/apoA1 with the level of education and household income and their joint impact on CAD mortality in participants of the UK Biobank (UKB) with and without prevalent CAD at enrollment. Hazard ratios for CAD mortality were estimated after adjusting for SDoH and clinical covariates.
In 292 804 participants without established CAD, apoB, and the apoB/apoA1 ratio were inversely associated with level of education and household income, whereas apoA1 was positively associated with household income. Adjustment for education level and household income coupled with the number of people living in the household did not attenuate the association between the apolipoprotein levels and incident CAD mortality rates. In a cohort of 13 826 participants with prevalent CAD, apoA1 levels were inversely associated with level of education. Higher apoB levels were only associated with greater CAD mortality risk after adjustment for risk factors. Risk estimation for CAD death through circulating apoA1 levels requires accounting for significant differences by sex.
Circulating lipid parameters are associated with SDoH in individuals without CAD. CAD mortality risk estimation through apoA1 and apoB levels does not require accounting for SDoH.",,,,,

In this cross-sectional study, we investigated prescription patterns of these drugs and identified inequities in antihyperglycemic utilization. Methods Unique encounters for diabetes care between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2020, were identified through a systematic query of our healthcare system's database. All patients ≥18 years old with a hemoglobin A1C level of ≥8% were included in the sample. Demographic data, SGLT2I or GLP-1RA prescription status, diabetes-related complications, and mortality were abstracted. Results A total of 2,746 patients were included in the sample. Among these individuals, 670 (24.4%) were prescribed either an SGLT2I or a GLP-1RA (users) and 2,076 (75.6%) were not prescribed either agent (non-users). There were significantly more males than females in the cohort, but there was no significant difference in the sex distribution between users and non-users. Compared to non-users, users were younger (mean age of 65.1 ± 9.4 years versus 66.4 ± 9.9 years, p-value = 0.005), more likely to be non-Hispanic (86.3% versus 13.7%), more likely to live in a middle-income zip code, and have private insurance. The mortality rate was lower among users when compared to non-users, but the difference did not reach statistical significance (2.7% versus 5.5%, p-value = 0.62). SGLT2I use was associated with a 60% lower risk of mortality. Conclusion Ethnicity, median household income, and insurance type influence the likelihood of being prescribed an SGLT2I or a GLP-1RA. Individuals prescribed either agent appear to have better mortality outcomes than those prescribed other medications. Further investigation may reveal underlying causes and potential solutions for disparities in prescription patterns.",,,,,

Lung development in childhood predicts lung function attained in adulthood and morbidity and mortality across the life course. We aimed to assess the effect of early-life lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) and associated risk factors on lung development from birth to school age in a South African birth cohort.
We prospectively followed children enrolled in a population-based cohort from birth (between March 5, 2012 and March 31, 2015) to age 5 years with annual lung function assessment. Data on multiple early-life exposures, including LRTI, were collected. The effect of early-life risk factors on lung function development from birth to age 5 years was assessed using the Generalised Additive Models for Location, Scale and Shape and Interrupted Time Series approach.
966 children (475 [49·2%] female, 491 [50·8%] male) had lung function measured with oscillometry, tidal flow volume loops, and multiple breath washout. LRTI occurred in 484 (50·1%) children, with a median of 2·0 LRTI episodes (IQR 1·0-3·0) per child. LRTI was independently associated with altered lung function, as evidenced by lower compliance (0·959 [95% CI 0·941-0·978]), higher resistance (1·028 [1·016-1·041]), and higher respiratory rate (1·018 [1·063-1·029]) over 5 years. Additional impact on lung function parameters occurred with each subsequent LRTI. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) LRTI was associated with lower expiratory flow ratio (0·97 [0·95-0·99]) compared with non-RSV LRTI. Maternal factors including allergy, smoking, and HIV infection were also associated with altered lung development, as was preterm birth, low birthweight, female sex, and coming from a less wealthy household.
Public health interventions targeting LRTI prevention, with RSV a priority, are vital, particularly in low-income and middle-income settings.

This retrospective, multi-center cohort study analyzed all brain tumor patients treated for SE at the university hospitals of Frankfurt and Marburg between 2011 and 2017.
The 208 patients (mean 61.5 ± 14.7 years of age; 51% male) presented with adult-type diffuse gliomas (55.8%), metastatic entities (25.5%), intracranial extradural tumors (14.4%), or other tumors (4.3%). The radiological criteria for tumor progression were evidenced in 128 (61.5%) patients, while 57 (27.4%) were newly diagnosed with tumor at admission and 113 (54.3%) had refractory SE. The mean hospital length of stay (LOS) was 14.8 days (median 12.0, range 1-57), 171 (82.2%) patients required intensive care (mean LOS 8.9 days, median 5, range 1-46), and 44 (21.2%) were administered mechanical ventilation. All patients exhibited significant functional status decline (modified Rankin Scale) post-SE at discharge (p < 0.001). Mortality at discharge was 17.3% (n = 36), with the greatest occurring in patients with metastatic disease (26.4%, p = 0.031) and those that met the radiological criteria for tumor progression (25%, p < 0.001). Long-term mortality at one year (65.9%) was highest in those diagnosed with adult-type diffuse gliomas (68.1%) and metastatic disease (79.2%). Refractory status epilepticus cases showed lower survival rates than non-refractory SE patients (log-rank p = 0.02) and those with signs of tumor progression (log-rank p = 0.001).
SE occurrence contributed to a decline in functional status in all cases, regardless of tumor type, tumor progression status, and SE refractoriness, while long-term mortality was increased in those with malignant tumor entities, tumor progressions, and refractory SE.

Low median household income (MHI) has been correlated with worsened surgical outcomes, but few studies have rigorously controlled for demographic and medical factors at the patient level. This study isolates the relationship between MHI and surgical outcomes in a lumbar fusion cohort using coarsened exact matching.
Patients undergoing single-level, posterior lumbar fusion at a single institution were consecutively enrolled and retrospectively analyzed (n = 4263). Zip code was cross-referenced to census data to derive MHI. Univariate regression correlated MHI to outcomes. Patients with low MHI were matched to those with high MHI based on demographic and medical factors. Outcomes evaluated included complications, length of stay, discharge disposition, 30- and 90 day readmissions, emergency department (ED) visits, reoperations, and mortality.
By univariate analysis, MHI was significantly associated with 30- and 90 day readmission, ED visits, reoperation, and non-home discharge, but not mortality. After exact matching (n = 270), low-income patients had higher odds of non-home discharge (OR = 2.5,

This population-based cohort study used registries in Denmark for children born with a major CA between January 1997 and December 2016, with follow-up until December 2018. We performed a latent class analysis (LCA) using child and family clinical and sociodemographic characteristics present at birth, incorporating additional variables occurring until age of 24 months. Cox proportional hazards regression models estimated hazard ratios (HRs) of pediatric mortality and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions for identified LCA classes.
The study included 27 192 children born with a major CA. Twelve variables led to a 4-class solution (entropy = 0.74): (1) children born with higher income and fewer comorbidities (55.4%), (2) children born to young mothers with lower income (24.8%), (3) children born prematurely (10.0%), and (4) children with multiorgan involvement and developmental disability (9.8%).

Therefore, we aimed to understand the impact of disability on postoperative outcomes.
We performed a retrospective cohort study using the Nationwide Readmission Database (2019). We compared patients ≥18 years undergoing emergency general surgery procedures with a disability condition with those without a disability. In accordance with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, disability was defined as severe hearing, visual, intellectual, or motor impairment/caregiver dependency. The primary outcome was 30-day readmission rates. Secondary outcomes included hospital length of stay and 30-day complications and mortality. Patients were 1:1 propensity-matched using patient, procedure, and hospital characteristics.
Among our population of 378,733 patients, 5,877 (1.6%) patients had at least 1 disability condition. A higher proportion of patients with a disability had low household income, $1 to $45,999, and an Elixhauser Comorbidity score ≥3. Among 5,768 matched pairs, patients with a disability had a significantly higher incidence of 30-day readmission (17.2% vs 12.7%; P < .001), infectious complications (29.8% vs 19.5%; P < .001), and a longer length of stay (8 vs 6 days; P < .001). Motor impairment, the most common disability, was associated with the greatest increase in patient readmission, morbidity, and length of stay.
Severe intellectual, hearing, visual, or motor impairments were associated with higher readmission, morbidity, and longer length of stay.

There is a persistent and widening pattern of income inequities for premature mortality. We sought to understand the combined effect of health behaviours and income on premature mortality in a large population-based cohort.
We analyzed a cohort of 121,197 adults in the 2005-2014 Canadian Community Health Surveys, linked to vital statistics data to ascertain deaths for up to 5 years following baseline. Information on household income quintile and mortality-relevant risk factors (smoking status, alcohol use, body mass index (BMI), and physical activity) was captured from the survey. Hazard ratios (HR) for combined income-risk factor groups were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models. Stratified Cox models were used to identify quintile-specific HR for each risk factor.
For each risk factor, HR of premature mortality was highest in the lowest-income, highest-risk group. Additionally, an income gradient was seen for premature mortality HR for every exposure level of each risk factor. In the stratified models, risk factor HRs did not vary meaningfully between income groups. All findings were consistent in the unadjusted and adjusted models.
These findings highlight the need for targeted strategies to reduce health inequities and more careful attention to how policies and interventions are distributed at the population level. This includes targeting and tailoring resources to those in lower income groups who disproportionately experience premature mortality risk to prevent further widening health inequities.",Income inequities are linked to premature mortality.,How do health behaviors and income jointly affect premature mortality?,Analysis of Canadian Community Health Surveys cohort linked to vital statistics data.,"Low-income, high-risk groups had highest premature mortality risk.","Relies on survey data, potential recall bias."

This study aims to reduce these knowledge gaps.
Using data from a large scale nationally representative linked dataset (2011 Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohorts), this study employed Fine-Gray subdistribution hazard models to estimate the link between socioeconomic status and deaths of despair due to suicide, drug overdose, and alcoholic liver disease among working age population (N = 4,076,530). Age stratified analysis was conducted to examine age heterogeneity.
Socioeconomic status, such as housing tenure, employment status, household income, and education level, was associated with deaths of despair among working age population. Age differences in the association between socioeconomic status and deaths of despair were found. While education level was pronounced for deaths of despair for younger adults, a combination of socioeconomic status was significantly associated with deaths of despair for those in late adulthood.

The research questions of this study were as follows: Are the sociodemographic factors (lower age of CYP, female gender, low socioeconomic status, low parental education), disease-related factors (high grade of tumor, presence of seizures, presence of hydrocephalous), and treatment-related factors (adjuvant therapy, no surgical intervention, post-treatment seizures, placement of shunts) associated with decline in neurcognition outcomes 12 months post-treatment in CYP with PBTs?
A prospective cohort study was conducted from November 2020 to July 2023 at the Aga Khan University Hospital and Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, tertiary care hospitals in Karachi, Pakistan. All CYP aged 5 to 21 years with a newly diagnosed PBTs were eligible. The neurocognition assessment was undertaken by a psychologist at two points, i.e., pre-treatment and at 12 months post-treatment using validated tools. The verbal intelligence was assessed by Slosson Intelligence tool, revised 3rd edition (SIT-R3), perceptual reasoning by Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM), and the Processing Speed Index by Wechsler Intelligence Scale (WISC V) and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-IV). The data were analyzed by STATA version 12 software. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) was used to determine the factors associated with the mean change in 12 months post-treatment verbal and non-verbal neurocognition scores. Unadjusted and adjusted beta coefficients with their 95% confidence intervals were reported.
A total of 48 CYPs with PBTs were enrolled, 23 (48%) of them were lost to follow-up and 10 (21%) died. The remaining 25 (52%) were reassessed 12 months after treatment. On multivariable analysis, a significant decline in verbal intelligence scores at 12 months was predicted by post-treatment seizures beta =  - 20.8 (95% CI, - 38.2, - 3.4), mothers having no formal educational status and lower household monthly income. Similarly, a significant decline in perceptual reasoning scores was also predicted by post-treatment seizures beta =  - 10.7 (95% CI, - 20.6, - 0.8), mothers having no formal education and having lower household monthly income. Worsening of processing speed scores at 12 months post-treatment were predicted by tumor histology, post-treatment seizures beta =  - 33.9 (95% CI, - 47.7, - 20.0), lower educational status of the mother, and having lower household monthly. However, an improvement was seen in processing speed scores after surgical tumor resection.
In this novel study, the post-treatment mean change in verbal and non-verbal neurocognition scores was associated with sociodemographic, tumor, and treatment factors. These findings may have potential implications for targeted early psychological screening of higher risk CYP with PBTs. Identification of these predictors may serve as a foundation for developing more cost-effective treatment thereby alleviating the burden of neurocognitive morbidity.

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we summarised the health effects from cooking or heating with gas compared with polluting fuels (eg, wood or charcoal) and clean energy (eg, electricity and solar energy). We searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library (CENTRAL), Environment Complete, GreenFile, Google Scholar, Wanfang DATA, and CNKI for articles published between Dec 16, 2020, and Feb 6, 2021.

Non-statistically significant effects were observed for asthma in children (OR 1·04, 0·70-1·55; p=0·84), asthma in adults (OR 0·65, 0·43-1·00; p=0·052), and small for gestational age (OR 1·04, 0·89-1·21; p=0·62). Compared with electricity, use of gas significantly increased risk of pneumonia (OR 1·26, 1·03-1·53; p=0·025) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR 1·15, 1·06-1·25; p=0·0011), although smaller non-significant effects were observed for higher-quality studies. In addition, a small increased risk of asthma in children was not significant (OR 1·09, 0·99-1·19; p=0·071) and no significant associations were found for adult asthma, wheeze, cough, and breathlessness (p>0·05). A significant decreased risk of bronchitis was observed (OR 0·87, 0·81-0·93; p<0·0001).
Switching from polluting fuels to gaseous household fuels could lower health risk and associated morbidity and mortality in resource-poor countries where reliance on polluting fuels is greatest. Although gas fuel use was associated with a slightly higher risk for some health outcomes compared with electricity, gas is an important transitional option for health in countries where access to reliable electricity supply for cooking or heating is not feasible in the near term.

Canada stands out among developed countries in not conducting a national household travel survey, leading to a dearth of national transportation mode data and risk calculations that have appropriate denominators. Since traffic injuries are specific to the mode of travel used, these risk calculations should consider travel mode.
Census data on mode of commute is one of the few sources of these data for persons aged 15 and over. This study leveraged a national data linkage cohort, the Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohorts, that connects census sociodemographic and commute mode data with records of deaths and hospitalizations, enabling assessment of road traffic injury associations by indicators of mode of travel (commuter mode). We examined longitudinal (1996-2019) bicyclist, pedestrian, and motor vehicle occupant injury and fatality risk in the Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohorts by commuter mode and sociodemographic characteristics using Cox proportional hazards models within the working adult population.
We estimated positive associations between commute mode and same mode injury and fatality, particularly for bicycle commuters (hazard ratios for bicycling injury was 9.1 and for bicycling fatality was 11). Low-income populations and Indigenous people had increased injury risk across all modes.

Wealth is known to be positively associated with longevity, but little is known about whether wealth redistribution might extend longevity.
To examine the association between wealth and longevity and estimate the changes in longevity that could occur with simulated wealth distributions that were perfectly equal, similar to that observed in Japan (among the most equitable of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD] countries), generated by minimum inheritance proposals, and produced by baby bonds proposals.
This longitudinal cohort study analyzed the association between wealth and survival among participants in the Health and Retirement Study (1992-2018), a nationally representative panel study of middle-aged and older (≥50 years) community-dwelling, noninstitutionalized US adults. The data analysis was performed between November 15, 2022, and September 24, 2023.
Household wealth on study entry, calculated as the sum of all assets minus the value of debts and classified into deciles.
Weibull survival models were used to estimate the association between per-person wealth decile and survival, adjusting for age, sex, marital status, household size, and race and ethnicity. Changes in longevity that might occur under alternative wealth distributions were then estimated.
The sample included 35 164 participants (mean [SE] age at study entry, 59.1 [0.1] years; 50.1% female and 49.9% male [weighted]). The hazard of death generally decreased with increasing wealth, wherein participants in the highest wealth decile had a hazard ratio of 0.59 for death (95% CI, 0.53-0.66) compared with those in the lowest decile, corresponding to a 13.5-year difference in survival. A simulated wealth distribution of perfect equality would increase populationwide median longevity by 2.2 years (95% CI, 2.2-2.3 years), fully closing the mortality gap between the US and the OECD average. A simulated minimum inheritance proposal would increase populationwide median longevity by 1.7 years; a simulated wealth distribution similar to Japan's would increase populationwide median longevity by 1.2 years; and a simulated baby bonds proposal would increase populationwide median longevity by 1.0 year.

Stratified by urban and rural groups, this study used a 10-year cohort to examine the mechanism of lifestyle and psychological resilience on the survival of the oldest-old in China.
This study used the China Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey datasets spanning from 2008 to 2018, and 9,250 eligible participants were included. The primary outcome variable was all-cause mortality, and independent variables included healthy lifestyle index and psychological resilience. Six covariates were included in the survival analysis and moderation-mediation model, such as gender and annual household income.
This study found that the oldest-old with five healthy lifestyles had the longest survival time, averaging 59.40 months for urban individuals and 50.08 months for rural individuals. As the lifestyle index increased, the survival rate significantly increased. The Cox regression showed that for the urban oldest-old, the lifestyle index served as a protective factor for survival outcomes. However, this effect lost statistical significance among rural oldest-old individuals. For urban oldest-old individuals, psychological resilience significantly mediated and moderated the effect of the lifestyle index on survival status, but the moderating effect was not statistically significant for the rural ones.
Overall, healthy lifestyles and psychological resilience can be effective in enhancing the survival of the oldest-old, and there are differences between urban and rural population, so different interventions should be adopted for urban and rural areas to achieve longer life in China.",Healthy lifestyles and psychological resilience influence longevity.,How do lifestyle and psychological resilience impact survival of the oldest-old in China?,Longitudinal study using China Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey data.,"Healthy lifestyles were associated with longer survival, with differences between urban and rural populations.","Relies on self-reported data, potential recall bias."

Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is one of the main contributors to liver cancer. Effective screening for both CRC and HCV exist and are recommended for individuals based upon age, regardless of gender or sex assigned at birth. Recommendations for both screening behaviors have been recently updated. However, screening rates for both CRC and HCV are suboptimal. Targeting adoption of multiple screening behaviors has the potential to reduce cancer mortality and disparities.
To examine psychosocial factors associated with completion of CRC and HCV screenings in order to inform a multi-behavioral educational intervention that pairs CRC and HCV screening information.
A cross-sectional survey was conducted with participants (N = 50) recruited at two community health centers in Florida (United States). Kruskal-Wallis and Fisher's exact tests were used to examine associations between completion of both CRC and HCV screening, CRC and HCV knowledge, Preventive Health Model constructs (e.g., salience and coherence, response efficacy, social influence), and sociodemographic variables.
Most participants were White (84%), female (56%), insured (80%), and reported a household income of $25,000 or less (53%). 30% reported ever previously completing both CRC and HCV screenings. Prior completion of both screening behaviors was associated with higher educational attainment (p = .014), having health insurance (p = .022), being U.S.-born (p = .043), and higher salience and coherence scores for CRC (p = .040) and HCV (p = .004).
Findings demonstrate limited uptake of both CRC and HCV screenings among adults born between 1945 and 1965. Uptake was associated with multiple sociodemographic factors and health beliefs related to salience and coherence. Salience and coherence are modifiable factors associated with completion of both screening tests, suggesting the importance of incorporating these health beliefs in a multi-behavioral cancer education intervention.

A cohort of 1.2 million low-income adults from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil with linked socioeconomic, demographic, healthcare use and mortality records was cross-sectionally analysed. Poisson regression models were used to investigate associations between self-defined race/colour and primary healthcare (PHC) usage, hospitalisation and mortality due to mental disorders, adjusting for socioeconomic factors. Interactions between race/colour and socioeconomic characteristics (sex, education level, income) explored if black and pardo (mixed race) individuals faced compounded risk of adverse mental health outcomes.
There were 272 532 PHC consultations, 10 970 hospitalisations and 259 deaths due to mental disorders between 2010 and 2016.

Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for the risks of youth-onset type 2 diabetes and all-cause mortality for all income groups vs the high-income group.
The cohort included a total of 5 182 893 children and adolescents (mean [SD] age, 11.2 [5.2] years; 2 477 807 girls [48.3%]). The mean (SD) follow-up duration was 9.0 (0.3) years. The incidence rates of youth-onset type 2 diabetes were 0.52 cases per 1000 person-years for the very-low-income group, 0.40 cases per 1000 person-years for the low-income group, 0.35 cases per 1000 person-years for the middle-income group, and 0.28 cases per 1000 person-years for the high-income group. Children and adolescents from very-low-income (aHR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.41-1.71), low-income (aHR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.27-1.41), and middle-income (aHR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.20-1.34) families had a significantly higher hazard of youth-onset type 2 diabetes than those from high-income families. Children and adolescents from very-low-income (aHR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.97-2.41), low-income (aHR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.42-1.60), and middle-income (aHR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.14-1.31) families also had a significantly higher hazard of all-cause mortality than those from high-income families. Children and adolescents who were older, female, and obese and had dyslipidemia, gout, or psychiatric disorders had a significantly higher risk of youth-onset type 2 diabetes than children without those characteristics.
This population-based cohort study showed that children and adolescents from very-low-income to middle-income families had a higher hazard of youth-onset type 2 diabetes and mortality than those from high-income families.

Our aim was to investigate the prevalence of and factors associated with high blood pressure (HBP) among adolescents.
The Pelotas 2004 Birth Cohort included 4231 newborns from hospital births in Pelotas, Brazil. A digital automatic OMRON sphygmomanometer (model HEM 742) was used to measure blood pressure on 3 occasions (at 6, 11, and 15 years of age). Those with blood pressure ≥95th percentile for age, height, and sex on each of the 3 occasions were considered as presenting HBP. Independent variables included family (income and history of arterial hypertension), maternal (schooling, age, pregestational body mass index, and smoking during pregnancy), and adolescent characteristics at birth (sex, skin color, gestational age, intrauterine growth, and systolic and diastolic genetic factors), and at 15 years (sleep, physical activity, sodium intake, screen time, work, body mass index, fat mass index, fat-free mass index, growth pattern, and puberty status). The prevalence of HBP (95% CI) was calculated. Crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) stratified by sex were obtained by logistic regression. A total of 1417 adolescents with complete information on blood pressure on the 3 occasions were analyzed. The prevalence of HBP was 3.2% (95% CI, 1.9%-4.5%) in female adolescents and 4.3% (95% CI, 2.8%-5.8%) in male adolescents. Female adolescents with a family history of arterial hypertension had a 3 times higher chance of HBP than their counterparts (OR, 3.1 [95% CI, 1.26-7.54]). In male adolescents, excessive maternal pregestational weight was associated with a 2.3-fold increase in the chance of HBP. In both sexes, excessive adolescent weight was associated with HBP (ORs, 3.5 and 5.0, for female and male adolescents, respectively). A higher fat mass index and fat-free mass index in female (ORs, 1.4 and 1.2, respectively) and male adolescents (ORs, 2.5 and 3.0, respectively) increased the chance of HBP. Among male adolescents, the chance of HBP was higher among those with rapid weight gain between 48 months and 6 years and between 6 and 11 years and rapid height gain between 6 and 11 years.

This retrospective cohort study used data from the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Difference in Stroke (REGARDS) cohort. Participants included adults who experienced an adjudicated hospitalization for HF between 2009 and 2017 in all 48 contiguous states in the US. Data analysis was performed from November 2022 to January 2023.

We investigate early-life diseases and the socioeconomic, psychosocial, and bio-behavioral factors behind this worsening health trend. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics Family and Individual Files 1968-2013, we find that the chronic disease index and poor subjective health have continuously increased for Baby Boomers and later cohorts. Early-life diseases, obesity, and shortening job tenure account for about half the health decline across cohorts. Weakening union protection, decreasing marriage, and declining religion only make minor contributions. All other factors, including early life nutrition and family background, adulthood socioeconomic status, physical activity, and smoking behaviors, make negative or non-significant contributions. These findings highlight that even though recent cohorts have better childhood nutrition, family socioeconomic environment,and higher levels of education and income, these advantages have been offset by elevated early-life disease exposure, obesity, and a precarious labor market.

Cross-sectional (n = 15 010, aged 35 to 74 years, baseline investigation period 2007 to 2012) and longitudinal data (5- and 10-year follow-ups from 2012 to 2022) from the Gutenberg Health Study were used to investigate the association between individual socioeconomic status (SES, measured via a validated questionnaire) and cardiovascular disease (CVD, composite of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, stroke, chronic heart failure, peripheral artery disease, and/or venous thromboembolism) risk and mortality. Subjects with prevalent CVD had a lower SES sum score, as well as lower education, occupation, and household net-income scores (all P < 0.0001). Logistic regression analysis showed that a low SES (vs. high, defined by validated cut-offs) was associated with 19% higher odds of prevalent CVD [odds ratio (OR) 1.19, 95% CI 1.01; 1.40] in the fully adjusted model. At 5-year follow-up, low SES was associated with both increased cardiovascular [hazard ratio (HR) 5.36, 2.24; 12.82] and all-cause mortality (HR 2.23, 1.51; 3.31). At 10-year follow-up, low SES was associated with a 68% higher risk of incident CVD (OR 1.68, 1.12; 2.47) as well as 86% higher all-cause mortality (HR 1.86, 1.55; 2.24). In general, the education and occupation scores were stronger related to risk of CVD and death than the household net-income score. Low SES was estimated to account for 451.45 disability-adjusted life years per 1000 people (years lived with disability 373.41/1000 and years of life lost 78.03/1000) and an incidence rate of 11 CVD cases and 3.47 CVD deaths per 1000 people per year. The population attributable fraction for CVD incidence after 5 years was 4% due to low SES.
Despite universal healthcare access, cumulative social disadvantage remains associated with higher risk of CVD and mortality. Dimensions of education and occupation, but not household net income, are associated with outcomes of interest.
Low socioeconomic status is associated with higher risk of incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality in a large cohort of the general population even after comprehensive adjustment for associated variables.

Hypertensive disparities among racialized groups are rooted in systemic inequalities, and we hypothesize that clinical markers of allostatic load capture embodied disparities in stressors that can link upstream social determinants of health with downstream hypertensive outcomes.
We analyzed observational cohort data from the Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: Monitoring Mothers-to-Be (n = 6,501) and developed a structural equation model linking latent social determinants of health, longitudinal markers of allostatic load across gestation, and hypertensive pregnancy outcomes in a multigroup framework.
Non-Hispanic Black mothers-to-be (n = 1,155) showed higher rates of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (32%) than non-Hispanic white women (n = 5,346, 23%). Among both groups, the social environment showed stronger direct effects on allostatic markers than via behaviorally mediated dietary, exercise, or smoking pathways. Demographic aspects of the social environment (e.g., household income, partnered status) were the most salient predictor of hypertensive risk and showed stronger effects among Black women.
Embodied stress rooted in the social environment is a major path driving maternal hypertensive disparities in the United States, with effects that vary across racialized groups. These pathway findings underscore the greater impact of systemic stressors relative to individual health behaviors. More comprehensive and detailed analyses of sociostructural domains are needed to identify promising avenues for policy and intervention to improve maternal health.",Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy disproportionately impact Black mothers.,Investigate the impact of cumulative social disadvantage on cardiovascular burden and mortality in a large cohort of the general population.,"Analysis of observational cohort data from the Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study, examining the association between social determinants of health, allostatic load, and hypertensive pregnancy outcomes.","Embodied stress rooted in the social environment is a major path driving maternal hypertensive disparities, with effects varying across racialized groups.","Relies on observational data, potential unmeasured confounders."

This study aimed to determine the impact of socioeconomic status (SES) on childhood cancer survival using pooled South African data.
Five databases spanning January 2000 to December 2021 were interrogated. SES status was assigned based on a public sector annual household income classification. H0 households (formally unemployed) received free healthcare. H1, H2 and H3 (annual income > United States Dollar [USD] 19,000) households paid for healthcare relative to their income. The Spearman test assessed correlations between SES and disease stage in patients with solid tumours. Hazard ratios were determined using Cox regression modelling. The Kaplan-Meier procedure estimated overall survival (OS).
A total of 1598 children were eligible for analysis; 1269 had a solid tumour with a negative correlation between SES and stage (Spearman rho = -.178; p < .001). Patients with solid tumours and lower SES showed proportionately higher numbers of stage III and IV disease (p < .01). This proportion decreased with higher SES categories. In the multivariate analyses adjusted for sex, age, tumour type and stage, higher SES was associated with lower mortality risk (p < .001), indicating that the impact of SES on survival was in excess of any effect that could be explained by lower stage disease alone. There was a strong positive correlation between race and SES (Fisher's exact tests, p < .001) across all groups and all SES strata. Five-year OS was 85.3% in children from H3 households versus 46.3% in children from H0 households (p < .001).

Despite growing awareness of socioeconomic disparities in the US health care system, significant inequities in outcomes remain. While recent literature has increasingly considered the effects of structural socioeconomic deprivation, the impact of community socioeconomic distress on outcomes following heart transplantation has not yet been elucidated.
All adult heart transplant recipients from 2004 to 2022 were ascertained from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network. Community socioeconomic distress was assessed using the previously validated Distressed Communities Index, a metric that represents education level, housing vacancies, unemployment, poverty rate, median household income, and business growth by zip code. Communities in the highest quintile were considered the Distressed cohort (others: Non-Distressed ). Outcomes were considered across 2 eras (2004-2018 and 2019-2022) to account for the 2018 UNOS Policy Change. Three- and 5-year patient and graft survival were assessed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards models.
Of 36,777 heart transplants, 7450 (20%) were considered distressed . Following adjustment, distressed recipients demonstrated a greater hazard of 5-year mortality from 2004 to 2018 [hazard ratio (HR)=1.10, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03-1.18; P =0.005] and 3-year mortality from 2019 to 2022 (HR=1.29, 95% CI: 1.10-1.51; P =0.002), relative to nondistressed . Similarly, the distressed group was associated with increased hazard of graft failure at 5 years from 2004 to 2018 (HR=1.10, 95% CI: 1.03-1.18; P =0.003) and at 3 years from 2019 to 2022 (HR=1.31, 95% CI: 1.11-1.53; P =0.001).

However, long-term trends and contributors of racial/ethnic disparities in all-cause and cause-specific death among patients with prostate cancer remain unclear. We analysed the trends and contributors of racial/ethnic disparities in prostate cancer survivors according to the cause of death in the US over 25 years.
In this retrospective, population-based longitudinal cohort study, we identified patients diagnosed with first primary prostate cancer between 1995 and 2019, with follow-up until Dec 31, 2019, using population-based cancer registries' data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program. We calculated the cumulative incidence of death for each racial/ethnic group (Black, white, Hispanic, Asian or Pacific Islander [API], and American Indian or Alaska Native [AI/AN] people), by diagnostic period and cause of death. We quantified absolute disparities using rate changes for the 5-year cumulative incidence of death between racial/ethnic groups and diagnostic periods. We estimated relative (Hazard ratios [HR]) racial/ethnic disparities and the percentage of potential factors contributed to racial/ethnic disparities using Cox regression models.
Despite a decreasing trend in the cumulative risk of death across five racial/ethnic groups, AI/AN and Black patients consistently had the highest rate of death between 1995 and 2019 with an adjusted HR of 1.48 (1.40-1.58) and 1.40 (1.38-1.42) respectively. The disparities in all-cause mortality between AI/AN and white patients increased over time, with adjusted HR 1.32 (1.17-1.49) in 1995-1999 and 1.95 (1.53-2.49) in 2015-2019. Adjustment of stage at diagnosis, initial treatment, tumor grade, and household income explained 33% and 24% of the AI/AN-white and Black-white disparities in all-cause death among patients with prostate cancer.
The enduring racial/ethnic disparities in patients with prostate cancer, call for new interventions to eliminate health disparities. Our study provides important evidence and ways to address racial/ethnic inequality.

Using nationwide data from Brazil, we aimed to estimate the incidence and investigate the socioeconomic and clinical determinants of tuberculosis in a cohort of contacts of tuberculosis patients.
In this cohort study, we linked individual socioeconomic and demographic data from the 100 Million Brazilian Cohort to mortality data and tuberculosis registries, identified contacts of tuberculosis index patients diagnosed from Jan 1, 2004 to Dec 31, 2018, and followed up the contacts until the contact's subsequent tuberculosis diagnosis, the contact's death, or Dec 31, 2018. We investigated factors associated with active tuberculosis using multilevel Poisson regressions, allowing for municipality-level and household-level random effects.
We studied 420 854 household contacts of 137 131 tuberculosis index patients. During the 15 years of follow-up (median 4·4 years [IQR 1·9-7·6]), we detected 8953 contacts with tuberculosis. The tuberculosis incidence among contacts was 427·8 per 100 000 person-years at risk (95% CI 419·1-436·8), 16-times higher than the incidence in the general population (26·2 [26·1-26·3]) and the risk was prolonged. Tuberculosis incidence was associated with the index patient being preschool aged (<5 years; adjusted risk ratio 4·15 [95% CI 3·26-5·28]) or having pulmonary tuberculosis (2·84 [2·55-3·17]).
The high and sustained risk of tuberculosis among contacts reinforces the need to systematically expand and strengthen contact tracing and preventive treatment policies in Brazil in order to achieve national and international targets for tuberculosis elimination.

However, there are concerns that this increase could deter appropriate emergency department (ED) visits and be associated with income-related disparities.
To examine changes in ED visits after the fee increase.
This retrospective cohort study used administrative data from June 2015 to May 2019 from all public hospitals in Hong Kong. Participants included all Hong Kong residents aged 64 years and younger, categorized into low-income, middle-income, and high-income groups according to the median household income in their district of residence. Data analysis was performed from May to June 2023.
The primary outcome was the ED visit rate per 100 000 people per month, categorized into 3 severity levels (emergency, urgent, and nonurgent). Secondary outcomes include general outpatient (GOP) visit rate, emergency admission rate, and in-hospital mortality rate per month at public hospitals. Segmented regression analyses were used to estimate changes in the level and slope of outcome variables before and after the fee increase.
This study included a total of 5 441 679 ED patients (2 606 332 male patients [47.9%]; 2 108 933 patients [38.5%] aged 45-64 years), with 2 930 662 patients (1 407 885 male patients [48.0%]; 1 111 804 patients [37.9%] aged 45-64 years) from the period before the fee increase. The fee increase was associated with an 8.0% (95% CI, 7.1%-9.0%) immediate reduction in ED visits after June 2017, including a 5.9% (95% CI, 3.3%-8.5%) reduction in urgent visits and an 8.9% (95% CI, 8.0%-9.8%) reduction in nonurgent visits. In addition, a 5.7% (95% CI, 4.7%-6.8%) reduction of emergency admissions was found, whereas no significant changes were observed in in-hospital mortality. Specifically, a statistically significant increase in GOP visits (4.1%; 95% CI, 0.9%-7.2%) was found within the low-income group, but this association became insignificant after controlling for the social security group, who were exempted from payment, as a control.
In this cohort study, the fee increase was not associated with changes in ED visits for emergency conditions, but there was a negative and significant association with both urgent and nonurgent conditions across all income groups.

The slope index of inequality (SII) and relative index of inequality (RII) were calculated for socioeconomic variables, while absolute difference (AD) and relative difference (RD) were used for gender and disability inequalities.
We observed a number of COVID-19-related health outcome inequalities. Gender inequality was particularly noticeable in infection rates, with the rate of women 1.16 times higher than that of men. In contrast, socioeconomic inequality was evident in vaccination rates, with a 4.5-fold (SII, -4.519; 95% confidence interval, -7.403 to -1.634) difference between the highest and lowest household income groups. Regarding clinical progression post-infection, consistent findings indicated higher risk for men (RD for hospitalization, 0.90; severe cases, 0.54; and fatality, 0.65), individuals with disabilities (RD for hospitalization, 2.27; severe cases, 2.29; and fatality, 2.37), and those from lower socioeconomic groups (SII for hospitalization, 1.778; severe cases, 0.089; and fatality, 0.451).
While the infection risk was nearly ubiquitous, not everyone faced the same level of risk post-infection. To prevent further health inequalities, it is crucial to develop a thoughtful policy acknowledging individual health conditions and resources.",Korean government's COVID-19 response is effective but lacks addressing health inequalities.,"What are the health inequalities related to COVID-19 in Korea, and how do they vary by gender, socioeconomic status, and disability?",Analysis of health outcome data using various health inequality indices and socioeconomic variables.,"Gender and socioeconomic inequalities were observed in infection rates and clinical progression post-infection.

Despite efforts to improve outcomes, mortality rates remain high, and certain disparities, including gender, may influence prognosis and mortality rates in SLE. This study aims to examine the gender disparities in outcomes of SLE hospitalizations in the US. Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database between 2016 and 2020. The NIS database is the largest publicly available all-payer database for inpatient care in the United States, representing approximately 20% of all hospitalizations nationwide. We selected every other year during the study period and included hospitalizations of adult patients (≥18 years old) with a primary or secondary diagnosis of SLE using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes. The control population consisted of all adult hospitalizations. Multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate the strength of the association between gender and primary and secondary outcomes. The regression models were adjusted for various factors, including age, race, median household income based on patients' zip codes, Charlson comorbidity index score, insurance status, hospital location, region, bed size, and teaching status. To ensure comparability across the years, revised trend weights were applied as the healthcare cost and use project website recommends. Stata version 17 (StataCorp LLC, TX, USA) was used for the statistical analyses, and a two-sided P-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Among the 42,875 SLE hospitalizations analyzed, women accounted for a significantly higher proportion (86.4%) compared to men (13.6%). The age distribution varied, with the majority of female admissions falling within the 30- to 60-year age range, while most male admissions fell within the 15- to 30-year age category. Racial composition showed a slightly higher percentage of White Americans in the male cohort compared to the female cohort. Notably, more Black females were admitted for SLE compared to Black males. Male SLE patients had a higher burden of comorbidities and were more likely to have Medicare and private insurance, while a higher percentage of women were uninsured. The mortality rate during the index hospitalization was slightly higher for men (1.3%) compared to women (1.1%), but after adjusting for various factors, there was no statistically significant gender disparity in the likelihood of mortality (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 1.027; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.570-1.852; P=0.929). Men had longer hospital stays and incurred higher average hospital costs compared to women (mean length of stay (LOS): seven days vs. six days; $79,751 ± $5,954 vs. $70,405 ± $1,618 respectively). Female SLE hospitalizations were associated with a higher likelihood of delirium, psychosis, and seizures while showing lower odds of hematological and renal diseases compared to men. Conclusion While women constitute the majority of SLE hospitalizations, men with SLE tend to have a higher burden of comorbidities and are more likely to have Medicare and private insurance. Additionally, men had longer hospital stays and incurred higher average hospital costs. However, there was no significant gender disparity in the likelihood of mortality after accounting for various factors.",Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) outcomes are influenced by gender disparities.,How do gender disparities affect outcomes of SLE hospitalizations in the US?,Retrospective analysis of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database for SLE hospitalizations.,Men with SLE had higher comorbidities and costs but similar mortality rates as women.

The prevalence of loneliness (overall 34%; 21% episodic, 13% chronic) far exceeded that of social isolation (overall 17%; 13% episodic, 4% chronic). There was consistency in the demographic characteristics (from age, sex, household type, income) of those who experienced loneliness and social isolation. However, people with a long-term health condition had an elevated risk of episodic loneliness (AOR 1.24, 95% CI 1.11-1.39) and a markedly higher risk of chronic loneliness (AOR 2.01, 95% CI 1.76-2.29), compared with those without a long-term health condition.

Studies on the effects of SDH on HIV/AIDS are limited, and do not yet provide a systematic understanding of how the various SDH act on important indicators of HIV/AIDS progression. We aimed to evaluate the effects of SDH on AIDS morbidity and mortality.
A retrospective cohort of 28.3 million individuals was evaluated over a 9-year period (from 2007 to 2015). Multivariable Poisson regression, with a hierarchical approach, was used to estimate the effects of SDH-at the individual and familial level-on AIDS incidence, mortality, and case-fatality rates.
A total of 28,318,532 individuals, representing the low-income Brazilian population, were assessed, who had a mean age of 36.18 (SD: 16.96) years, 52.69% (14,920,049) were female, 57.52% (15,360,569) were pardos, 34.13% (9,113,222) were white/Asian, 7.77% (2,075,977) were black, and 0.58% (154,146) were indigenous. Specific socioeconomic, household, and geographic factors were significantly associated with AIDS-related outcomes. Less wealth was strongly associated with a higher AIDS incidence (rate ratios-RR: 1.55; 95% confidence interval-CI: 1.43-1.68) and mortality (RR: 1.99; 95% CI: 1.70-2.34). Lower educational attainment was also greatly associated with higher AIDS incidence (RR: 1.46; 95% CI: 1.26-1.68), mortality (RR: 2.76; 95% CI: 1.99-3.82) and case-fatality rates (RR: 2.30; 95% CI: 1.31-4.01). Being black was associated with a higher AIDS incidence (RR: 1.53; 95% CI: 1.45-1.61), mortality (RR: 1.69; 95% CI: 1.57-1.83) and case-fatality rates (RR: 1.16; 95% CI: 1.03-1.32). Overall, also considering the other SDH, individuals experiencing greater levels of socioeconomic deprivation were, by far, more likely to acquire AIDS, and to die from it.
In the population studied, SDH related to poverty and social vulnerability are strongly associated with a higher burden of HIV/AIDS, most notably less wealth, illiteracy, and being black. In the absence of relevant social protection policies, the current worldwide increase in poverty and inequalities-due to the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the effects of war in the Ukraine-could reverse progress made in the fight against HIV/AIDS in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC).

Data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, which includes participants from 6 US field centers, were used to create an index of baseline Social Disadvantage Score (SDS) to explore its association with incident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and all-cause mortality and impact on ASCVD risk prediction. SDS, which ranges from 0 to 4, was calculated by tallying the following social factors: (1) household income less than the federal poverty level; (2) educational attainment less than a high school diploma; (3) single-living status; and (4) experience of lifetime discrimination. Cox models were used to examine the association between SDS and each outcome with adjustment for traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Changes in the discrimination and reclassification of ASCVD risk by incorporating SDS into the pooled cohort equations were examined.
A total of 6434 participants (mean age, 61.9±10.2 years; female 52.8%; non-white 60.9%) had available SDS 1733 (26.9%) with SDS 0; 2614 (40.6%) with SDS 1; 1515 (23.5%) with SDS 2; and 572 (8.9%) with SDS ≥3.

However, little is known about how these health and mortality effects vary across the lifespan and may be differentially impacted by various components of the environment. Here, we leveraged a relatively new and powerful model for human aging, the companion dog, to investigate which components of the social environment are associated with dog health and how these associations vary across the lifespan. We drew on comprehensive survey data collected on 21,410 dogs from the Dog Aging Project and identified five factors that together explained 33.7% of the variation in a dog's social environment. Factors capturing financial and household adversity were associated with poorer health and lower physical mobility in companion dogs, while factors that captured social support, such as living with other dogs, were associated with better health when controlling for dog age and weight. Notably, the effects of each environmental component were not equal: the effect of social support was 5× stronger than financial factors. The strength of these associations depended on the age of the dog, including a stronger relationship between the owner's age and the dog's health in younger as compared to older dogs. Taken together, these findings suggest the importance of income, stability and owner's age on owner-reported health outcomes in companion dogs and point to potential behavioral and/or environmental modifiers that can be used to promote healthy aging across species.",Social environmental adversity impacts health outcomes.,How do social environmental factors affect health in companion dogs?,"Comprehensive survey data analysis on 21,410 dogs to identify factors associated with health outcomes.","Financial and household adversity are associated with poorer health in companion dogs, while social support improves health outcomes.","Focused on companion dogs, may not generalize to other species, and potential biases in survey data."

The study examines factors affecting the choice of eating fruits and vegetables by household members and calculates eating frequency probabilities of different population-origin associated with personal attributes and behavior.
Turkish Health Survey (THS) 2019 data from the Turkish Statistical Institute (TSI) national representative household panel is applied. Estimating a random-effect bivariate probit model of fruit and vegetable choice, we calculated marginal probabilities of choosing fruits and vegetables, the joint probability of choosing both, and conditional probabilities between choosing to eat either, detecting consumption synergy.
The role of uncontrolled variables in choosing to eat fruits and vegetable (F&V) differs between the decision of an average family and the decision of individual family members. The attitude is positive for an average family and contrasts with the negative attitude among some family members. Most individual and family attributes inversely affect fruit and vegetable choice across different groups, while a positive relationship exists between the likelihood of fruit and vegetable choice and attributes such as age, marital status, education, weight, having health insurance, income, and time and forms of physical activity.
Instead of a general policy for the implementation of a healthy and balanced nutrition program to improve fruit and vegetable eating frequency, it appears more effective to adopt programs with distinct characteristics that segregate society into different cohorts.

The knowledge about to what extent and how hearing impairment matters for health is currently lacking. Thus, we aimed to comprehensively examine the adverse health consequences as well as the comorbidity patterns of undiagnosed hearing loss.
Based on the prospective cohort of the UK Biobank, we included 14,620 individuals (median age 61 years) with audiometry-determined (i.e., speech-in-noise test) objective hearing loss and 38,479 individuals with subjective hearing loss (i.e., tested negative but with self-reported hearing problems; median age 58 years) at recruitment (2006-2010), together with 29,240 and 38,479 matched unexposed individuals respectively.
Cox regression was used to determine the associations of both hearing-loss exposures with the risk of 499 medical conditions and 14 cause-specific deaths, adjusting for ethnicity, annual household income, smoking and alcohol intake, exposure to working noise, and BMI. Comorbidity patterns following both exposures were visualized by comorbidity modules (i.e., sets of connected diseases) identified in the comorbidity network analyses.
During a median follow-up of 9 years, 28 medical conditions and mortality related to nervous system disease showed significant associations with prior objective hearing loss. Subsequently, the comorbidity network identified four comorbidity modules (i.e., neurodegenerative, respiratory, psychiatric, and cardiometabolic diseases), with the most pronounced association noted for the module related to neurodegenerative diseases (meta-hazard ratio [HR] = 2.00, 95%confidence interval [CI] 1.67-2.39). For subjective hearing loss, we found 57 associated medical conditions, which were partitioned into four modules (i.e., diseases related to the digestive, psychiatric, inflammatory, and cardiometabolic systems), with meta-HRs varying from 1.17 to 1.25.
Undiagnosed hearing loss captured by screening could identify individuals with at greater risk of multiple adverse health consequences, highlighting the importance of screening for speech-in-noise hearing impairment in the middle-aged population, for potential early diagnosis and intervention.",,,,,

In these settings, sanitation infrastructure is of variable and often inadequate quality, creating risks of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacterales transmission. We aimed to describe the prevalence, distribution, and risks of ESBL-producing Enterobacterales colonisation in sub-Saharan Africa using a One Health approach.
Between April 29, 2019, and Dec 3, 2020, we recruited 300 households in Malawi for this longitudinal cohort study: 100 each in urban, peri-urban, and rural settings. All households underwent a baseline visit and 195 were selected for longitudinal follow-up, comprising up to three additional visits over a 6 month period. Data on human health, antibiotic usage, health-seeking behaviours, structural and behavioural environmental health practices, and animal husbandry were captured alongside human, animal, and environmental samples. Microbiological processing determined the presence of ESBL-producing E coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and hierarchical logistic regression was performed to evaluate the risks of human ESBL-producing Enterobacterales colonisation.
A paucity of environmental health infrastructure and materials for safe sanitation was identified across all sites. A total of 11 975 samples were cultured, and ESBL-producing Enterobacterales were isolated from 1190 (41·8%) of 2845 samples of human stool, 290 (29·8%) of 973 samples of animal stool, 339 (66·2%) of 512 samples of river water, and 138 (46·0%) of 300 samples of drain water. Multivariable models illustrated that human ESBL-producing E coli colonisation was associated with the wet season (adjusted odds ratio 1·66, 95% credible interval 1·38-2·00), living in urban areas (2·01, 1·26-3·24), advanced age (1·14, 1·05-1·25), and living in households where animals were observed interacting with food (1·62, 1·17-2·28) or kept inside (1·58, 1·00-2·43). Human ESBL-producing K pneumoniae colonisation was associated with the wet season (2·12, 1·63-2·76).
There are extremely high levels of ESBL-producing Enterobacterales colonisation in humans and animals and extensive contamination of the wider environment in southern Malawi. Urbanisation and seasonality are key risks for ESBL-producing Enterobacterales colonisation, probably reflecting environmental drivers. Without adequate efforts to improve environmental health, ESBL-producing Enterobacterales transmission is likely to persist in this setting.

The association between vehicle ownership and all-cause mortality after MI was assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression models.
A total of 30,126 patients were included (age 68.1 +/- 13.5 years, 63.2% male). After adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and medical comorbidities, lower vehicle ownership was associated with increased all-cause mortality after MI (hazard ratio [HR] 1.10; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06-1.14; 
Lower vehicle ownership was associated with increased mortality after MI.

Data quality issues such as under-reporting and misreporting have greatly limited the usefulness of such data. We aimed to enhance the use of mortality data in surveys by proposing data quality metrics and exploring adjustment procedures to obtain the best possible measure of perinatal mortality.
We performed a population-based analysis of data from 157 demographic and health surveys (DHSs) from 1990 to 2020, with reproductive calendar and birth history data from 53 LMICs. Pregnancies terminated before 7 months' gestation were excluded. We examined data quality and compared survey values with reference values obtained from a literature review to assess misreporting of the age at early neonatal death, omission and transference of stillbirths, and very early neonatal deaths. Real cohort life-table rates of stillbirth, early neonatal, and perinatal mortality per 1000 births were calculated. The underlying risks of stillbirth and daily deaths were modelled using modified Gompertz-Makeham models.
Data for 2 008 807 pregnancies of ≥7 months' gestational age were extracted from the reproductive calendar for the analysis period. Age heaping at day 7 occurred in most surveys. The median value for the heaping index of deaths at day 7 was 2·05 (IQR 1·36-2·87). The median ratio of stillbirths to deaths on days 0-1 was 1·15 (0·86-1·51). Of the 157 surveys, 23 (15%) were considered to have plausible ratios, 71 (45%) had probable ratios, and 63 (40%) had improbable ratios. The ratio of deaths on days 0-1 to deaths on days 2-6 varied considerably between surveys and 119 surveys (76%) had ratios of less than 2·4, indicative of under-reporting of very early neonatal deaths in most surveys. The fully adjusted model increased the median stillbirth rates from 12·2 (9·4-15·9) to 25·6 (18·0-33·4) per 1000 births, with a median relative increase of 95·0% (56·6-136·6). The median perinatal mortality rate also increased from 32·6 (23·6-38·3) to 44·8 (32·8-58·0) per 1000 births, with a median relative increase of 47·8% (6·9-61·0).
A simultaneous focus on stillbirths and early neonatal mortality facilitates a comprehensive assessment of inaccurate reporting in household surveys and allows for better use of surveys in planning and monitoring of efforts to reduce stillbirths and early neonatal mortality.

This study aimed to examine the trends and determinants of stunting from infancy to middle adolescence in four countries: Ethiopia, India, Peru, and Vietnam.
A 15-year longitudinal data on the trends of stunting were obtained from the Young Lives cohort study. The study includes 38,361 observations from 4 countries. A generalized mixed-effects model was adopted to estimate the determinant of stunting.
The patterns of stunting in children from aged 1 to 15 years have declined from an estimated 30% in 2002 to 20% in 2016. Stunting prevalence varied among four low- and middle-income countries with children in Ethiopia, India, and Peru being more stunted compared to children in Vietnam. The highest stunted was recorded in India and the lowest was recorded in Vietnam. In all four countries, the highest prevalence of severe stunting was observed in 2002 and moderate stunting was observed in 2006. Parents' education level played a significance role in determining a child stunting. Children of uneducated parents were shown to be at a higher risk of stunting.
Disparities of stunting were observed between- and within-country of four low- and middle-income with the highest prevalence recorded in low-income country. Child stunting is caused by factors related to child's age, household wealth, household size, the mother's and father's education level, residence area and access to save drinking water.",,,,,

We compared ED visits and disposition outcomes for 5.8 million pediatric patients (<18 years old) with and without cancer, and used multivariable regressions to estimate associations between the number of ED visits, hospital (inpatient) admissions through the ED, and ED or inpatient mortality and sociodemographic and clinical factors within the cancer cohort.
Pediatric patients with cancer had more ED visits per year on average (2.4 vs. 1.5, p < .001), higher shares of admissions (56.8% vs. 6.6%, p < .001) and mortality (1.2% vs. 0.1%, p < .001) compared to those without cancer.

However, there are few studies of the DunedinPACE measure among socioeconomically and racially diverse cohorts with longitudinal assessments.
To investigate the association of race and poverty status with DunedinPACE scores in a socioeconomically diverse middle-aged cohort of African American and White participants.
This longitudinal cohort study used data from the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity Across the Life Span (HANDLS) study. HANDLS is a population-based study of socioeconomically diverse African American and White adults aged 30 to 64 years at baseline in Baltimore, Maryland, with follow-up approximately every 5 years. The current study was restricted to 470 participants with blood samples at 2 time points: August 14, 2004, to June 22, 2009 (visit 1), and June 23, 2009, to September 12, 2017 (visit 2). Genome-wide DNAm was assessed at visit 1 (chronological age, 30-64 years) and visit 2. Data were analyzed from March 18, 2022, to February 9, 2023.
DunedinPACE scores were estimated for each participant at 2 visits. DunedinPACE scores are values scaled to a mean of 1, interpretable with reference to a rate of 1 year of biological aging per 1 year of chronological aging. Linear mixed-model regression analysis was used to examine the trajectories of DunedinPACE scores by chronological age, race, sex, and poverty status.
Among 470 participants, the mean (SD) chronological age at visit 1 was 48.7 (8.7) years. Participants were balanced by sex (238 [50.6%] were men and 232 [49.4%] were women), race (237 [50.4%] African American and 233 [49.6%] White), and poverty status (236 [50.2%] living below poverty level and 234 [49.8%] living above poverty level). The mean (SD) time between visits was 5.1 (1.5) years. Overall, the mean (SD) DunedinPACE score was 1.07 (0.14), representing a 7% faster pace of biological aging than chronological aging. Linear mixed-effects regression analysis revealed an association between the 2-way interaction between race and poverty status (White race and household income below poverty level: β = 0.0665; 95% CI, 0.0298-0.1031; P < .001) and significantly higher DunedinPACE scores and an association between quadratic age (age squared: β = -0.0113; 95% CI, -0.0212 to -0.0013; P = .03) and significantly higher DunedinPACE scores.
In this cohort study, household income below poverty level and African American race were associated with higher DunedinPACE scores. These findings suggest that the DunedinPACE biomarker varies with race and poverty status as adverse social determinants of health. Consequently, measures of accelerated aging should be based on representative samples.",DunedinPACE measure is associated with morbidity and mortality.,How does race and poverty status influence DunedinPACE scores in a diverse cohort?,Longitudinal cohort study using data from the HANDLS study to analyze DunedinPACE scores by race and poverty status.,"Household income below poverty level and African American race were associated with higher DunedinPACE scores, indicating accelerated aging.","Focused on specific cohort data, potential biases in data collection, and limited generalizability to other populations."

Participants in the Canadian Community Health Survey (n = 289,800) were followed longitudinally for CVD morbidity and mortality using administrative health and mortality data. SEP was measured as a latent variable consisting of household income and individual educational attainment. Mediators included smoking, physical inactivity, obesity, diabetes and hypertension. The primary outcome was CVD morbidity and mortality, defined as the first fatal/nonfatal CVD event during follow-up (median 6.2 years). Generalized structural equation modeling tested the mediating effects of modifiable risk factors in associations between SEP and CVD in the total population and stratified by sex. Lower SEP was associated with 2.5 times increased odds of CVD morbidity and mortality (OR: 2.52, 95% CI: 2.28, 2.76). Modifiable risk factors mediated 74% of associations between SEP and CVD morbidity and mortality in the total population and were more important mediators of associations in females (83%) than males (62%). Smoking mediated these associations independently and jointly with other mediators. The mediating effects of physical inactivity were through joint mediating effects with obesity, diabetes or hypertension. There were additional joint mediating effects of obesity through diabetes or hypertension in females. Findings point to modifiable risk factors as important targets for interventions along with interventions that target structural determinants of health to reduce socioeconomic inequities in CVD.",,,,,

Accessing high-resolution surveillance data to understand community-level etiology and risk remains challenging, particularly in remote and resource limited populations. A multi-year prospective cohort study was conducted in two rural and two peri-urban villages in Cambodia from 2012 to 2018 to describe the epidemiology and etiology of acute diarrheal diseases within the population. Suspected diarrheal episodes among participants were self-reported or detected via routine weekly household visits. Fresh stool and fecal swabs were tested, and acute-illness and follow-up participant questionnaires collected. Of 5027 enrolled participants, 1450 (28.8%) reported at least one diarrheal incident. A total of 4266 individual diarrhea case events were recorded. Diarrhea incidence rate was calculated to be 281.5 persons per 1000 population per year, with an event rate of 664.3 individual diarrhea events occurring per 1000 population per year. Pathogenic Escherichia coli, Aeromonas spp., and Plesiomonas shigelloides were the most prevalent bacterial infections identified. Hookworm and Strongyloides stercoralis were the predominant helminth species, while Blastocystis hominis and Giardia lamblia were the predominant protozoan species found. Norovirus genotype 2 was the predominant virus identified. Mixed infections of two or more pathogens were detected in 36.2% of positive cases.

However, not all patients see a cardiologist when they are hospitalized for HF. Since reasons for this are not entirely clear, we sought to determine whether social determinants of health (SDOH) are associated with cardiologist involvement in the management of adults hospitalized for HF. We hypothesized that SDOH would be inversely associated with cardiologist involvement in the care of adults hospitalized for HF.
We included adult participants from the national REasons for Geographic And Racial Difference in Stroke (REGARDS) cohort, who experienced an adjudicated hospitalization for HF between 2009 and 2017. We excluded participants who were hospitalized at institutions that lacked cardiology services (n=246). We examined nine candidate SDOH, which align with the Healthy People 2030 conceptual model: Black race, social isolation (0-1 visits from a family or friend in the past month), social network/caregiver availability (having someone to care for them if ill), educational attainment < high school, annual household income < $35,000, living in rural areas, living in a zip code with high poverty, living in a Health Professional Shortage Area, and residing in a state with poor public health infrastructure. The primary outcome was cardiologist involvement, a binary variable which was defined as involvement of a cardiologist as the primary responsible clinician or as a consultant, collected via chart review. We examined associations between each SDOH and cardiologist involvement using Poisson regression with robust standard errors. Candidate SDOH with statistically significant associations (p<0.10) were retained for multivariable analysis. Potential confounders/covariates for the multivariable analysis included age, race, sex, HF characteristics, comorbidities, and hospital characteristics.
We examined 876 participants hospitalized at 549 unique US hospitals. The median age was 77.5 years (IQR 71.0-83.7), 45.9% were female, 41.4% were Black, and 56.2% had low income. Low household income (<$35,000/year) was the only SDOH that had a statistically significant association with cardiologist involvement in a bivariate analysis (RR: 0.88 [95% CI: 0.82-0.95]). After adjusting for potential confounders, low income remained inversely associated (RR: 0.89 [95% CI: 0.82-0.97]).

There were 984 and 834 HAEC admissions during the pre-pandemic and pandemic periods, respectively (2.6 vs. 1.9 HAEC admissions per 10,000 patient-days, incident rate ratio [95% confidence interval]: 0.74 [0.67, 0.81], p < 0.001). Compared to pre-pandemic, those with HAEC during the pandemic were younger (median [IQR]: 566 [162, 1430] days pandemic vs. 746 [259, 1609] days pre-pandemic, p < 0.001) and more likely to live in the lowest quartile of median household income zip codes (24% pandemic vs. 19% pre-pandemic, p = 0.02). There were no significant differences in rates of sepsis (6.1% pandemic vs. 6.1% pre-pandemic, p > 0.9), bowel perforation (1.3% pandemic vs. 1.2% pre-pandemic, p = 0.8), ICU admissions (9.6% pandemic vs. 12% pre-pandemic, p = 0.2), mortality (0.5% pandemic vs. 0.6% pre-pandemic, p = 0.8), or length of stay (median [interquartile range]: 4 [(Pastor et al., 2009; Gosain and Brinkman, 2015) 2,112,11 days pandemic vs. 5 [(Pastor et al., 2009; Tang et al., 2020) 2,102,10 days pre-pandemic, p = 0.4).
The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with significantly decreased incidence of HAEC admissions across US children's hospitals. Possible etiologies such as social distancing should be explored.

Billions of dollars are spent annually to improve urban water supply, and rigorous evaluation of these improvements, especially targeting informal settlements, is critical to guide policy and investment strategies. Objective measures of infection and exposure to pathogens, and measures of gut function, are needed to understand the effectiveness and impact of water supply improvements.
In the PAASIM study, we examine the impact of water system improvements on acute and chronic health outcomes in children in a low-income urban area of Beira, Mozambique, comprising 62 sub-neighbourhoods and ~26 300 households. This prospective matched cohort study follows 548 mother-child dyads from late pregnancy through 12 months of age. Primary outcomes include measures of enteric pathogen infections, gut microbiome composition and source drinking water microbiological quality, measured at the child's 12-month visit. Additional outcomes include diarrhoea prevalence, child growth, previous enteric pathogen exposure, child mortality and various measures of water access and quality. Our analyses will compare (1) subjects living in sub-neighbourhoods with the improved water to those living in sub-neighbourhoods without these improvements; and (2) subjects with household water connections on their premises to those without such a connection. This study will provide critical information to understand how to optimise investments for improving child health, filling the information gap about the impact of piped water provision to low-income urban households, using novel gastrointestinal disease outcomes.

To explore associations between modifiable CHCs and late mortality within the context of social determinants of health.
This longitudinal cohort study used data from 9440 individuals who were eligible to participate in the St Jude Lifetime Cohort (SJLIFE), a retrospective cohort study with prospective clinical follow-up that was initiated in 2007 to characterize outcomes among childhood cancer survivors. Eligible individuals had survived 5 or more years after childhood cancer diagnosis, were diagnosed between 1962 and 2012, and received treatment at St Jude Children's Research Hospital were included in mortality estimates. A total of 3407 adult SJLIFE participants (aged ≥18 years) who completed an on-campus assessment were included in risk factor analyses. Vital status, date of death, and cause of death were obtained by linkage with the National Death Index (coverage from inception to December 31, 2016). Deaths occurring before inception of the National Death Index were obtained from the St Jude Children's Research Hospital Cancer Registry. Data were analyzed from June to December 2022.
Data on treatment exposures and causes of death were abstracted for individuals who were eligible to participate in the SJLIFE study. Information on modifiable CHCs (dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, underweight or obesity, bone mineral deficiency, hypogonadism, hypothyroidism, and adrenal insufficiency, all graded by the modified Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events), healthy lifestyle index (smoking status, alcohol consumption, body mass index [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared], and physical activity), area deprivation index (ADI; which measures neighborhood-level socioeconomic disadvantage), and frailty (low lean muscle mass, exhaustion, low energy expenditure, slowness, and weakness) was obtained for participants.
National Death Index causes of death were used to estimate late mortality using standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and 95% CIs, which were calculated based on US mortality rates. For the risk factor analyses (among participants who completed on-campus assessment), multivariable piecewise exponential regression analysis was used to estimate rate ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs for all-cause and cause-specific late mortality.
Among 9440 childhood cancer survivors who were eligible to participate in the SJLIFE study, the median (range) age at assessment was 27.5 (5.3-71.9) years, and the median (range) duration of follow-up was 18.8 (5.0-58.0) years; 55.2% were male and 75.3% were non-Hispanic White. Survivors experienced increases in all-cause mortality (SMR, 7.6; 95% CI, 7.2-8.1) and health-related late mortality (SMR, 7.6; 95% CI, 7.0-8.2). Among 3407 adult SJLIFE participants who completed an on-campus assessment, the median (range) age at assessment was 35.4 (17.9-69.8) years, and the median (range) duration of follow-up was 27.3 (7.3-54.7) years; 52.5% were male and 81.7% were non-Hispanic White. Models adjusted for attained age, sex, race and ethnicity, age at diagnosis, treatment exposures, household income, employment status, and insurance status revealed that having 1 modifiable CHC of grade 2 or higher (RR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.2-4.0; P = .01), 2 modifiable CHCs of grade 2 or higher (RR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.4-4.9; P = .003), or 3 modifiable CHCs of grade 2 or higher (RR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.8-7.1, P < .001); living in a US Census block with an ADI in the 51st to 80th percentile (RR, 5.5; 95% CI, 1.3-23.5; P = .02), an ADI in the 81st to 100th percentile (RR, 8.7; 95% CI, 2.0-37.6; P = .004), or an unassigned ADI (RR, 15.7; 95% CI, 3.5-70.3; P < .001); and having frailty (RR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.3-3.9; P = .004) were associated with significant increases in the risk of late all-cause death. Similar associations were observed for the risk of late health-related death (1 modifiable CHC of grade ≥2: RR, 2.2 [95% CI, 1.1-4.4; P = .02]; 2 modifiable CHCs of grade ≥2: RR, 2.5 [95% CI, 1.2-5.2; P = .01]; 3 modifiable CHCs of grade ≥2: RR, 4.0 [95% CI, 1.9-8.4; P < .001]; ADI in 51st-80th percentile: RR, 9.2 [95% CI, 1.2-69.7; P = .03]; ADI in 81st-100th percentile: RR, 16.2 [95% CI, 2.1-123.7; P = .007], unassigned ADI: RR, 27.3 [95% CI, 3.5-213.6; P = .002]; and frailty: RR, 2.3 [95% CI, 1.2-4.1; P = .009]).
In this cohort study of childhood cancer survivors, living in a Census block with a high ADI and having modifiable CHCs were independently associated with an increased risk of late death among survivors of childhood cancer.

Methodology We conducted a cross-sectional study using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) obtained from hospitals in the United States. Our sample included 21,385 adult patients (aged ≥18 years) with a primary discharge diagnosis of AML. The sample was further grouped by inpatients who were managed with HSCT and chemotherapy as the primary procedure. We compared the demographic characteristics and hospital outcomes in AML inpatients across treatment cohorts by performing descriptive statistics and Pearson's chi-square test. Next, we measured the differences in continuous variables (length of stay and cost) using the analysis of variance (ANOVA). All analyses were conducted using SPSS version 26 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Results The hospital-based utilization rate of HSCT was 0.4% in AML inpatients. The utilization rate of HSCT was higher in females (0.5%), African Americans (0.6%), those with median household incomes above the 50th percentile (0.5%), and those covered by private insurance (0.8%). A significantly higher proportion of AML inpatients with HSCT had depression (22.2% vs. 11.4% in total). AML inpatients receiving HSCT had significantly longer hospitalization stays and higher treatment costs than those receiving chemotherapy. The all-cause inpatient mortality was 11.6% in AML inpatients. Statistically, there were no significant differences by treatment. Conclusions HSCT appears to be underutilized for the treatment of AML. This treatment had a higher utilization rate in females and those from high-income families and was covered by private insurance.

Data sources include hospitals, primary care (individual diagnoses), the Swedish National Tax Agency (death dates), the Total Population Register ""RTB"" (sex, age, birth country), the Household Register (size of household), the Integrated Database For Labor Market Research ""LISA"" (educational level, income, and occupation), and SmiNet (COVID data). Individual exposures include education, income, type of work and ability to work from home, living area and living conditions as well as the individual country of origin and co-morbidities. Additionally, we have data on the risks associated with living areas. We used a Cox proportional hazards model and logistic regression to estimate associations. Area-level covariates were used in a principal component analysis to generate a measurement of neighborhood deprivation. As outcomes, we used hospitalization and death due to COVID-19.
Among the 1,782,125 persons, male sex, comorbidities, higher age, and not being born in Sweden increase the risk of hospitalization and death. So does lower education and lower income, the lowest incomes doubled the risk of death from COVID-19. Area estimates, where the model includes individual risks, show that high population density and a high percentage of foreign-born inhabitants increased the risk of hospitalization.

Patient-specific factors including geography, income, insurance status, age, and gender have been shown to bias surgical outcomes. Utilizing a prospectively collected all-payer database, we aim to evaluate the influence of socioeconomic factors on mortality and length of stay (LOS) after common cardiac surgical procedures.
We utilized the National Inpatient Sample, Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality for the year 2019. We included patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), aortic valve replacement (AVR), transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), and combined AVR/CABG using the 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases procedure codes. AVR and CABG were combined into a separate cohort as this was felt to represent a different pathology than isolated valvular or coronary arterial disease. Baseline demographics were summarized. Multivariable regression was performed within each procedure group to model the odds of in-hospital mortality and hospital LOS with age, sex, insurance, zip-code median household income, and location as predictors.
Baseline patient characteristics including gender, income, geography, and payer status were similar between CABG, AVR, and AVR/CABG. TAVR patients had a higher proportion of female sex and Medicare as the primary payer, with an overall greater age. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression found that higher income was strongly associated with decreased LOS following AVR and CABG, and moderately associated in TAVR and AVR/CABG. Private insurance was associated with a decreased LOS in patients undergoing CABG, AVR, TAVR, and AVR/CABG. Female sex and increased age were associated with increased odds of mortality in TAVR, CABG, and AVR/CABG. Private insurance was associated with a decreased odds of mortality in patients undergoing AVR.
These findings reveal significant disparities in patient outcomes after routine cardiac operations that are associated with socioeconomic status. Patients who did not have private insurance or had lower incomes were found to be at risk for increased LOS. Women were at a higher risk of mortality for several operations, a finding which has been previously described elsewhere. Private insurance conveyed a decreased odds of mortality in patients undergoing AVR. This data set serves to highlight differences in healthcare outcomes based on a variety of socioeconomic, geographic, and other inherent factors.

The role of wealth inequality in mediating racial health inequities is unclear.
To assess the contribution of wealth inequities to the longevity gap that exists between Black and White individuals in the US and to model the potential effects of reparations payments on this gap.
This cohort study analyzed the association between wealth and survival among participants in the Health and Retirement Study, a nationally representative panel study of community-dwelling noninstitutionalized US adults 50 years or older that assessed data collected from April 1992 to July 2019. Participants included 7339 non-Hispanic Black (hereinafter Black) and 26 162 non-Hispanic White (hereinafter White) respondents. Data were analyzed from January 1 to September 17, 2022.
Household wealth, the sum of all assets (including real estate, vehicles, and investments), minus the value of debts.
The primary outcome was all-cause mortality by the end of survey follow-up in 2018. Using parametric survival models, the associations among household wealth, race, and survival were evaluated, adjusting for age, sex, number of household members, and marital status. Additional models controlled for educational level and income. The survival effects of eliminating the current mean wealth gap with reparations payments ($828 055 per household) were simulated.
Of the 33 501 individuals in the sample, a weighted 50.1% were women, and weighted mean (SD) age at study entry was 59.3 (11.1) years. Black participants' median life expectancy was 77.5 (95% CI, 77.0-78.2) years, 4 years shorter than the median life expectancy for White participants (81.5 [95% CI, 81.2-81.8] years). Adjusting for demographic variables, Black participants had a hazard ratio for death of 1.26 (95% CI, 1.18-1.34) compared with White participants. After adjusting for differences in wealth, survival did not differ significantly by race (hazard ratio, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.92-1.08]).

Underlying community factors may contribute to disparities in peripartum cardiomyopathy outcomes.
This study aimed to identify the geographic distribution of and disparities in peripartum cardiomyopathy outcomes, hypothesizing that patients living in communities with higher social vulnerability may have worse outcomes.
This was a retrospective cohort study of patients with peripartum cardiomyopathy per the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute definition from January 2000 to November 2017 at a single center, excluding those with a post office box address as a post office box address may not reflect the census tract in which a patient resides. Severe peripartum cardiomyopathy (vs less severe peripartum cardiomyopathy) was defined as ejection fraction <30%, death, intensive care unit admission, left ventricular assist device or implantable cardioverter defibrillator placement, or transplant. The US census tract for the patient's address was linked to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Social Vulnerability Index, a 0 to 1 scale of a community's vulnerability to external stresses on health, with higher values indicating greater vulnerability. The Social Vulnerability Index includes social factors divided into socioeconomic, household composition, minority status, and housing type and transportation themes. The Social Vulnerability Index and Social Vulnerability Index components were compared among patients by peripartum cardiomyopathy severity.
Of 95 patients in the original cohort, 5 were excluded because of the use of a post office box address. Of the remaining 90 patients, 56 met severe peripartum cardiomyopathy criteria. At baseline, individuals with and without severe peripartum cardiomyopathy had similar ages, marital status, payor type, tobacco use, gestational age at delivery, and mode of delivery; however, individuals with severe peripartum cardiomyopathy were more likely to be Black (vs White) (59% vs 29%; P<.007) and less likely to recover ejection fraction (EF) to ≥55% by 12 months (36% vs 62%; P=.02) than individuals with less severe peripartum cardiomyopathy. Patients with severe peripartum cardiomyopathy were more likely to live in areas with a higher Social Vulnerability Index (0.51 vs 0.31; P=.002) and with more residents who were unemployed, impoverished, without a high school diploma, in single-parent households, of minority status, without a vehicle, and in institutionalized group quarters than patients with less severe peripartum cardiomyopathy. The median income was lower in communities of individuals with severe peripartum cardiomyopathy than in communities of individuals with less severe peripartum cardiomyopathy.
Patients with severe peripartum cardiomyopathy outcomes were more likely to live in communities with greater social vulnerability than patients with less severe peripartum cardiomyopathy outcomes.

Although Medicare coverage may help address a major financial barrier to accessing alloHCT, there remains an unmet need for alloHCT owing to sociodemographic disparities. This study examined trends and factors associated with the utilization of alloHCT and the estimated unmet need for alloHCT among Medicare beneficiaries with AML. This retrospective cohort study included patients (age 65 to 74 years) with a diagnosis of AML identified in Medicare claims data from 2010 through 2016. To study trends in utilization, transplantation rates were calculated as the number of patients who underwent alloHCT within 180 days and 1 year of diagnosis (numerator) divided by the total number of patients with AML within each diagnosis year (denominator). A multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with the likelihood of undergoing alloHCT within 1 year of diagnosis. Two approaches were applied to estimate the unmet need for alloHCT. The first approach used claims data to identify the potential need for alloHCT among patients who achieved complete remission for at least 90 days. The second approach used established National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) methodology, which considers estimates of risk level, response to treatment, comorbidity, and early mortality, to identify the potential and unmet need for alloHCT. The overall estimated need and unmet need from 2010 to 2015 and over different time periods were evaluated for both approaches. The alloHCT rate within 180 days of diagnosis increased from 8% in 2010 to 15.8% in 2016 (P < .001), and the 1-year alloHCT rate also increased over time, from 11.9% in 2010 to 20.0% in 2015 (P < .001). The likelihood of undergoing alloHCT within 1 year of diagnosis was associated with diagnosis year, age, race, geographic region, Elixhauser Comorbidity Index, and population-level median household income. Between 2010 and 2015, the claims data approach estimated a lower potential need for alloHCT compared with the NMDP methodology estimate (27% versus 36%); both approaches estimated that 43% to 44% of patients with a potential need for alloHCT had an unmet treatment need. Despite the differences in estimated potential need between the 2 approaches, both showed a sustained unmet need but with a downward trend over time. Our data show that utilization of alloHCT has increased over time among Medicare beneficiaries with AML. Two approaches of need analysis were conducted for validation of estimated need and unmet need for alloHCT using claim-identified remission status, given the lack of cytogenetics and molecular information in claims data. Both approaches to estimating the unmet need for alloHCT found a downward trend over time; however, there are differences in utilization of alloHCT by age, race, geographic region, comorbidity, and socioeconomic status, indicating disparities in access to alloHCT among Medicare beneficiaries with AML.

Although a number of quantitative studies have highlighted a range of potential socio-cultural, economic and health system factors influencing paediatric post-discharge treatment-seeking and recovery, few studies have explored family and provider perspectives of the post-discharge period in-depth.
This work was part of a large, multi-country prospective cohort study, the Childhood Acute Illness and Nutrition (CHAIN) Network. We conducted a qualitative sub-study to understand the post-discharge treatment-seeking and recovery experiences of families of undernourished children aged 2-23 months admitted in a rural and urban icddr,b (International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh) hospital. Methods included repeat in-depth interviews (73 interviews in total) with 29 family members of 17 purposively selected children. These data were supplemented by interviews with 33 health workers, and by observations in hospitals and homes.
Important drivers of treatment-seeking perceived to support recovery included advice provided to family members while in hospital, media campaigns on hygiene practice, availability of free treatment, and social and financial support from family members, relatives and neighbours. Key perceived challenges included low household incomes, mothers having to juggle multiple responsibilities in addition to caring for the sick child, lack of support (sometimes violence) from the child's father, and family members' preference for relatively accessible drug shops, physicians or healers over hospital admission.
Development of interventions that address the challenges that families face is essential to support post-discharge adherence to medical advice and recovery. Potential interventions include strengthening information giving during hospitalization on what post-discharge care is needed and why, reducing direct and indirect costs associated with hospital visits, engaging fathers and other 'significant others' in post-discharge advice, and building mobile phone-based support for follow-up care.",Post-hospital discharge mortality is high among undernourished children in low and middle-income countries.,What are the post-discharge treatment-seeking and recovery experiences of families of undernourished children?,"Qualitative sub-study within a larger cohort study.

Pre-existing inequalities among immigrants may threaten their economic wellbeing during the pandemic. This study analyzed the socioeconomic impact of COVID-19 on immigrants and natives living in Amadora, Metropolitan Region of Lisbon and the extent to which preexisting inequalities had been exacerbated during the pandemic.
This cross-sectional study was conducted in Amadora Municipality, Lisbon Region, through phone interviews and using a structured questionnaire. Data collected in July 2020, included information on a cohort of 420 households, of which 51% were immigrants. To evaluate the socioeconomic position and economic wellbeing changes occurring during the pandemic we estimate crude and adjusted odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI, using Portuguese natives as the reference group.
Overall, 287 (70%) participants responded to the questionnaire, of which 47% are immigrants. Preexisting socioeconomic inequalities were exacerbated during the pandemic. Compared with natives, immigrants were more likely to experience job loss, temporary lay-off, and income loss during the COVID-19 pandemic. Immigrants were also more likely to face several kinds of financial hardship during the pandemic, such as difficulties in buying food, hygiene products, and paying bills.
To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to capture the direct socioeconomic impact of COVID-19 among immigrants and natives in Portugal. It highlights the bidirectional relation between inequalities deeply rooted among immigrants and COVID-19. Socioeconomic inequalities affect local patterns of COVID-19 burden, as confirmed in previous studies, but COVID-19 also has an impact on the economic wellbeing of Amadora immigrants during the pandemic.

Black patients have a disproportionate burden of obesity and cardiovascular disease and have a higher rate of cardiovascular-related mortality. Racial and ethnic disparities in health outcomes are largely attributable to the pervasiveness of structural racism, and patients who are marginalized by racism have less access to novel therapeutics.
To evaluate GLP-1 RA uptake among a commercially insured population of patients with T2D; identify associations of race, ethnicity, sex, and socioeconomic status with GLP-1 RA use; and specifically examine its use among the subgroup of patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) because of the known benefit of GLP-1 RA use for this population.
This was a retrospective cohort analysis using data from OptumInsight Clinformatics Data Mart of commercially insured adult patients with T2D (with or without ASCVD) in the US. Data from October 1, 2015, to June 31, 2019, were included, and the analyses were performed in July 2020. We estimated multivariable logistic regression models to identify the association of race, ethnicity, sex, and socioeconomic status with GLP-1 RA use.

Of the 1 180 260 patients with T2D (median [IQR] age, 69 [59-76] years; 50.3% female; 57.7% White), 90 934 (7.7%) were treated with GLP-1 RA during the study period. From 2015 to 2019, the percentage of T2D patients treated with an GLP-1 RA increased from 3.2% to 10.7%. Among patients with T2D and ASCVD, use also increased but remained low (2.8%-9.4%). In multivariable analyses, lower rates of GLP-1 RA use were found among Asian (aOR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.56-0.62), Black (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.81; 95% CI, 0.79-0.83), and Hispanic (aOR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.88-0.93) patients with T2D.

We estimated prevalence of known chronic disease comorbidities and their association with outcomes among injured patients in Cameroon.
Injured patients aged ≥15 y presenting to four Cameroonian hospitals between October 2017 and January 2020 were included. Our explanatory variable was known chronic disease; prevalence was age-standardized. Outcomes were overall in-hospital mortality and admission or transfer from the emergency department (ED). Associations between known chronic disease and outcomes were evaluated using logistic regression adjusted for age, gender, estimated injury severity score (eISS), hospital, and household socioeconomic status. Unadjusted eISS-stratified and age-stratified outcomes were also compared via chi-squared tests.
Of 7509 injured patients, 370 (4.9%) reported at least one known chronic disease; age-standardized prevalence was 8.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 7.5%-9.2%). Patients with known chronic disease had higher mortality (4.6% versus 1.5%, adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.61 [95% CI: 1.25-5.47], P = 0.011) and were more likely to be admitted or transferred from the ED (38.7% versus 19.8%, aOR: 1.40 [95% CI: 1.02-1.92], P = 0.038) compared to those without known comorbidities. Crude differences in mortality (11.3% versus 3.3%, P = 0.002) and hospital admission or transfer (63.8% versus 46.6%, P = 0.011) were most notable for patients with eISS 16-24.

Diets high in sodium (predominantly sodium chloride) and low in potassium contribute to elevated blood pressure. The WHO recommends decreasing mean population sodium intake through effective and safe strategies to reduce hypertension and its associated disease burden. Incorporating low-sodium salt substitutes (LSSS) into population strategies has increasingly been recognised as a possible sodium reduction strategy, particularly in populations where a substantial proportion of overall sodium intake comes from discretionary salt. The LSSS contain lower concentrations of sodium through its displacement with potassium predominantly, or other minerals. Potassium-containing LSSS can potentially simultaneously decrease sodium intake and increase potassium intake.  Benefits of LSSS include their potential blood pressure-lowering effect and relatively low cost. However, there are concerns about potential adverse effects of LSSS, such as hyperkalaemia, particularly in people at risk, for example, those with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or taking medications that impair potassium excretion.
To assess the effects and safety of replacing salt with LSSS to reduce sodium intake on cardiovascular health in adults, pregnant women and children.
We searched MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase (Ovid), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Web of Science Core Collection (Clarivate Analytics), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL, EBSCOhost), ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 18 August 2021, and screened reference lists of included trials and relevant systematic reviews. No language or publication restrictions were applied.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective analytical cohort studies in participants of any age in the general population, from any setting in any country. This included participants with non-communicable diseases and those taking medications that impair potassium excretion. Studies had to compare any type and method of implementation of LSSS with the use of regular salt, or no active intervention, at an individual, household or community level, for any duration.
Two review authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full-text articles to determine eligibility; and extracted data, assessed risk of bias (RoB) using the Cochrane RoB tool, and assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. We stratified analyses by adults, children (≤ 18 years) and pregnant women. Primary effectiveness outcomes were change in diastolic and systolic blood pressure (DBP and SBP), hypertension and blood pressure control; cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality were additionally assessed as primary effectiveness outcomes in adults. Primary safety outcomes were change in blood potassium, hyperkalaemia and hypokalaemia.
We included 26 RCTs, 16 randomising individual participants and 10 randomising clusters (families, households or villages). A total of 34,961 adult participants and 92 children were randomised to either LSSS or regular salt, with the smallest trial including 10 and the largest including 20,995 participants. No studies in pregnant women were identified. Studies included only participants with hypertension (11/26), normal blood pressure (1/26), pre-hypertension (1/26), or participants with and without hypertension (11/26). This was unknown in the remaining studies. The largest study included only participants with an elevated risk of stroke at baseline. Seven studies included adult participants possibly at risk of hyperkalaemia. All 26 trials specifically excluded participants in whom an increased potassium intake is known to be potentially harmful. The majority of trials were conducted in rural or suburban settings, with more than half (14/26) conducted in low- and middle-income countries. The proportion of sodium chloride replacement in the LSSS interventions varied from approximately 3% to 77%. The majority of trials (23/26) investigated LSSS where potassium-containing salts were used to substitute sodium. In most trials, LSSS implementation was discretionary (22/26). Trial duration ranged from two months to nearly five years.  We assessed the overall risk of bias as high in six trials and unclear in 12 trials. LSSS compared to regular salt in adults: LSSS compared to regular salt probably reduce DBP on average (mean difference (MD) -2.43 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.50 to -1.36; 20,830 participants, 19 RCTs, moderate-certainty evidence) and SBP (MD -4.76 mmHg, 95% CI -6.01 to -3.50; 21,414 participants, 20 RCTs, moderate-certainty evidence) slightly.  On average, LSSS probably reduce non-fatal stroke (absolute effect (AE) 20 fewer/100,000 person-years, 95% CI -40 to 2; 21,250 participants, 3 RCTs, moderate-certainty evidence), non-fatal acute coronary syndrome (AE 150 fewer/100,000 person-years, 95% CI -250 to -30; 20,995 participants, 1 RCT, moderate-certainty evidence) and cardiovascular mortality (AE 180 fewer/100,000 person-years, 95% CI -310 to 0; 23,200 participants, 3 RCTs, moderate-certainty evidence) slightly, and probably increase blood potassium slightly (MD 0.12 mmol/L, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.18; 784 participants, 6 RCTs, moderate-certainty evidence), compared to regular salt.  LSSS may result in little to no difference, on average, in hypertension (AE 17 fewer/1000, 95% CI -58 to 17; 2566 participants, 1 RCT, low-certainty evidence) and hyperkalaemia (AE 4 more/100,000, 95% CI -47 to 121; 22,849 participants, 5 RCTs, moderate-certainty evidence) compared to regular salt. The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of LSSS on blood pressure control, various cardiovascular events, stroke mortality, hypokalaemia, and other adverse events (very-low certainty evidence). LSSS compared to regular salt in children: The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of LSSS on DBP and SBP in children. We found no evidence about the effects of LSSS on hypertension, blood pressure control, blood potassium, hyperkalaemia and hypokalaemia in children.
When compared to regular salt, LSSS probably reduce blood pressure, non-fatal cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality slightly in adults. However, LSSS also probably increase blood potassium slightly in adults. These small effects may be important when LSSS interventions are implemented at the population level. Evidence is limited for adults without elevated blood pressure, and there is a lack of evidence in pregnant women and people in whom an increased potassium intake is known to be potentially harmful, limiting conclusions on the safety of LSSS in the general population. We also cannot draw firm conclusions about effects of non-discretionary LSSS implementations.

Recent retrospective data suggest that earlier operative intervention may decrease morbidity. However, management decisions are influenced by surgical outcomes. Our goal was to determine the current surgical management of SBO in older patients with particular attention to frailty and the timing of surgery.
A retrospective review of patients over the age of 65 with a diagnosis of bowel obstruction (ICD-10 K56*) using the 2016 National Inpatient Sample (NIS). Demographics included age, race, insurance status, medical comorbidities, and median household income by zip code. Elixhauser comorbidities were used to derive a previously published frailty score using the NIS dataset. Outcomes included time to operation, mortality, discharge disposition, and hospital length of stay. Associations between demographics, frailty, timing of surgery, and outcomes were determined.
264,670 patients were included. Nine percent of the cohort was frail; overall mortality was 5.7%. Frail had 1.82 increased odds of mortality (95% CI 1.64-2.03). Hospital LOS was 1.6 times as long for frail patients; a quarter of the frail were discharged home. Frail patients waited longer for surgery (3.58 days vs 2.44 days; p < 0.001). Patients transferred from another facility had increased mortality (aOR 1.58; 95% CI 1.36-1.83). There was an increasing mortality associated with a delay in surgery.
Patients with frailty and SBO have higher mortality, more frequent discharge to dependent living, longer hospital length of stay, and longer wait to operative intervention. Mortality is also associated with male gender, black race, transfer status from another facility, self-pay status, and low household income. Every day in delay in surgical intervention for those who underwent operations led to higher mortality.

Evidence on specific green space types, including private residential gardens is less well established.
We examined associations of greenspace with all-cause, non-injury, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and respiratory disease deaths in UK Biobank - a national prospective cohort of adults with linked Office for National Statistics mortality records. We included private residential gardens and other greenspace types, e.g., public parks, sport facilities, using categories from Ordnance Survey MasterMap™ Greenspace. We used Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted for individual and area-level covariates, and stratified analyses by sex, household income, and area-level deprivation. In sensitivity analyses, we further adjusted for air pollution, road-traffic noise, indirect tobacco smoke exposure, and physical activity, and restricted analyses to non-movers.
In 232,926 participants, we observed 13,586 all-cause, 13,159 non-injury, 2,796 cardiovascular (CVD), and 968 respiratory disease deaths. Private residential garden cover showed inverse associations with all-cause, non-injury, CVD, and chronic respiratory disease mortality, after adjustment for covariates and other types of greenspace, with hazard ratios and 95 % confidence intervals of 0.94 (0.91, 0.97), 0.95 (0.92, 0.97), 0.92 (0.86, 0.98) and 0.87 (0.78, 0.98), respectively, per interquartile range (IQR) increase in private residential garden cover (IQR = 21.6 % increase within 100 m buffer). Other greenspace types showed weaker inverse associations with CVD and chronic respiratory disease mortality than private residential gardens. Sex, household income, and area level deprivation modified associations. Findings were robust to sensitivity analyses.

Patients in lower income neighborhoods (N = 103) were 45% Hispanic, 34% White, and 14% Asian versus upper income neighborhoods (N = 103), which were 48% White, 31% Asian, and 12% Hispanic (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the rates of intrapartum cardiac events (10% vs. 4%; p = 0.16), postpartum cardiac events (14% vs. 17%; p = 0.7), and preterm delivery (24% vs. 17%; p = 0.23). The rates of antepartum hospitalization were higher for lower income neighborhoods (42% vs 22%; p = 0.004). While there is no significant difference in cardiac events and preterm delivery rates between patients from low versus high income neighborhoods, patients from lower income neighborhoods have higher antepartum hospitalization rates. Earlier identification of clinical deterioration provided by a cardio-obstetrics team may contribute to increased hospitalizations, which might mitigate socioeconomic disparities in outcomes for these pregnant patients with heart disease.",,,,,

We aimed to assess short-term and long-term risk of mortality, neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI), and health-care use and household income in cohorts of children with and without a history of bacterial meningitis during infancy in Denmark and the Netherlands.
In this nationwide cohort study, infants with a history of bacterial meningitis before age 1 year were identified through the Danish Medical Birth Registry and Danish National Patient Registry using International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 codes and through the Netherlands Reference Laboratory for Bacterial Meningitis. Infants were matched (1:10) by sex and birth month and year to a comparison cohort of the general population without a history of bacterial meningitis. We analysed mortality using Cox proportional hazards regression. In Denmark, diagnoses of NDIs were based on ICD-10 codes; in the Netherlands, special educational needs were used as a functional NDI outcome. Risk ratios (RRs) of NDIs were estimated using modified Poisson regression. We also analysed long-term health-care use in Denmark and household income in both countries. All regression analyses were adjusted for sex and year of birth, and stratified by pathogen whenever sample size allowed.
We included 2216 children with a history of bacterial meningitis (570 [25·7%] in Denmark between Jan 1, 1997, and Dec 31, 2018, and 1646 [74·3%] in the Netherlands between Jan 1, 1995, and Dec 31, 2018), matched to 22 127 comparison cohort members. Median age at diagnosis was 2·8 months (IQR 0·4-7·1) in Denmark and 4·3 months (0·7-7·4) in the Netherlands. Mortality risks within 3 months after disease onset were 3·9% (95% CI 2·6-5·8%) in Denmark and 5·9% (4·7-7·0) in the Netherlands, compared with 0·0% (p<0·0001) and 0·1% (p<0·0001) in the comparison cohorts. Survivors had an increased risk of moderate or severe NDIs at age 10 years (RR 5·0 [95% CI 3·5-7·1] in Denmark and 4·9 [4·0-6·2] in the Netherlands) compared to children in the comparison cohort, particularly after pneumococcal and group B streptococcal meningitis. In Denmark, a history of bacterial meningitis was associated with increased health-care use in the 10 years following diagnosis (rate ratio 4·5 [95% CI 3·9-5·2] for outpatient visits and 4·1 [3·6-4·7] for hospital admissions).
Our study shows increased risk of mortality in the short and long term, a five times increase in risk of NDIs, and increased health-care use after bacterial meningitis during infancy. Together with context-specific incidence data, our results can advance pathogen-specific estimation of the meningitis burden and inform service provision at the individual and population level.

In contrast to young children, the frequency of small airway infection in adult bronchiolitis appears less frequent and a number of other pathophysiological conditions have been implicated in adult bronchiolitis. However, little information is available on the exact medical burden of bronchiolitis such as its prevalence and comorbidities in the adult population. The aim of this study is to elucidate the prevalence and comorbidities of bronchiolitis. We used the Korea National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort, which provides data for 1,000,000 individuals out of the entire population by 2% stratified random sampling according to age, sex, residential area, and level of household income. We defined the cause of bronchiolitis other than acute infection as a patient with diagnostic code J448 or J684 and over 20 years of age who visited a clinic or hospital in South Korea. Then, 1:1 propensity score matching was performed to define a non-bronchiolitis (control) group to compare the comorbidities and mortality in the 2 groups. The overall prevalence of bronchiolitis was 688 cases/1,000,000 population during the study period (95% confidence interval, 625-751). The most common comorbid clinical condition in adults with bronchiolitis was rhinitis (52.3%), followed by bronchial asthma (52.23%), hypertension (43.69%), gastroesophageal reflux disease (30.56%), sinusitis (28.72%), diabetes (22.77%), and osteoporosis (17.85%). Other common bronchiolitis-associated comorbidities were cerebrovascular disease (16.86%), angina (14.37%), peripheral vascular disease (13.42%), congestive heart failure (11.9%), and malignancy in any organ (10.6%). Healthcare costs for bronchiolitis increased steeply during the same period. Malignancy in any organ was the leading cause of mortality in the patient group, followed by bronchiolitis itself.

Large cohort studies are needed to characterize the independent impact of environmental exposures on mortality in low-income settings.
We collected data on individual and environmental risk factors for a multiethnic cohort of 50,045 individuals in a low-income region in Iran. Environmental risk factors included: ambient fine particular matter air pollution; household fuel use and ventilation; proximity to traffic; distance to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) center; socioeconomic environment; population density; local land use; and nighttime light exposure. We developed a spatial survival model to estimate the independent associations between these environmental exposures and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.
Several environmental factors demonstrated associations with mortality after adjusting for individual risk factors. Ambient fine particulate matter air pollution predicted all-cause mortality (per μg/m3, HR 1.20, 95% CI 1.07, 1.36) and cardiovascular mortality (HR 1.17, 95% CI 0.98, 1.39). Biomass fuel use without chimney predicted all-cause mortality (reference = gas, HR 1.23, 95% CI 0.99, 1.53) and cardiovascular mortality (HR 1.36, 95% CI 0.99, 1.87). Kerosene fuel use without chimney predicted all-cause mortality (reference = gas, HR 1.09, 95% CI 0.97, 1.23) and cardiovascular mortality (HR 1.19, 95% CI 1.01, 1.41). Distance to PCI center predicted all-cause mortality (per 10km, HR 1.01, 95% CI 1.004, 1.022) and cardiovascular mortality (HR 1.02, 95% CI 1.004, 1.031). Additionally, proximity to traffic predicted all-cause mortality (HR 1.13, 95% CI 1.01, 1.27). In a separate validation cohort, the multivariable model effectively predicted both all-cause mortality (AUC 0.76) and cardiovascular mortality (AUC 0.81). Population attributable fractions demonstrated a high mortality burden attributable to environmental exposures.

This study sought to investigate the impact of patients' SES on the risk of bleeding after mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR).
This nationwide population-based cohort study included all patients aged 18-70 years who underwent mechanical AVR in Sweden from 1997 to 2018. Data were obtained from the SWEDEHEART register and other national health data registers. The exposure was quartiles of household disposable income. The primary outcome was hospitalization for a bleeding event.
Among 5974 patients, the absolute risk for bleeding after 20 years of follow-up was 20% (95% CI: 17%-24%) in the lowest income quartile (Q1) and 16% (95% CI: 13%-20%) in the highest quartile (Q4). The risk of bleeding decreased with increasing income level and was significantly lower in patients in income level Q3 (HR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.60-0.99) and Q4 (HR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.50-0.92) than Q1. The risk of death from intracranial hemorrhage was five times higher in the lowest income quartile than the age- and sex-matched general Swedish population (standardized mortality ratio: 5.0; 95% CI: 3.3-7.4).
We observed a strong association between SES and risk of bleeding among patients who underwent mechanical AVR. These findings suggest suboptimal anticoagulation treatment in patients with lower SES and the need for strategies to optimize anticoagulation treatment in patients with a mechanical heart valve.

Considering the scant evidence directly comparing the safety profiles of mRNA and inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, this territory-wide cohort study aims to compare the incidence of various adverse events of special interest (AESIs) and all-cause mortality between CoronaVac (inactivated vaccine) and BNT162b2 (mRNA-based vaccine). Our results can help vaccine recipients make an informed choice.
A retrospective, population-based cohort of individuals who had received at least 1 dose of BNT162b2 or CoronaVac from 23 February to 9 September 2021 in Hong Kong, and had data linkage to the electronic medical records of the Hong Kong Hospital Authority, were included. Those who had received mixed doses were excluded. Individuals were observed from the date of vaccination (first or second dose) until mortality, second dose vaccination (for first dose analysis), 21 days after vaccination, or 30 September 2021, whichever came first. Baseline characteristics of vaccinated individuals were balanced between groups using propensity score weighting. Outcome events were AESIs and all-cause mortality recorded during 21 days of post-vaccination follow-up after each dose, except anaphylaxis, for which the observation period was restricted to 2 days after each dose. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of AESIs and mortality comparing between CoronaVac and BNT162b2 recipients were estimated after each dose using Poisson regression models. Among 2,333,379 vaccinated individuals aged 18 years or above, the first dose analysis included 1,308,820 BNT162b2 and 955,859 CoronaVac recipients, while the second dose analysis included 1,116,677 and 821,560 individuals, respectively. The most frequently reported AESI among CoronaVac and BNT162b2 recipients was thromboembolism (first dose: 431 and 290 per 100,000 person-years; second dose: 385 and 266 per 100,000 person-years). After the first dose, incidence rates of overall AESIs (IRR = 0.98, 95% CI 0.89-1.08, p = 0.703) and mortality (IRR = 0.96, 95% CI 0.63-1.48, p = 0.868) associated with CoronaVac were generally comparable to those for BNT162b2, except for Bell palsy (IRR = 1.95, 95% CI 1.12-3.41, p = 0.018), anaphylaxis (IRR = 0.34, 95% CI 0.14-0.79, p = 0.012), and sleeping disturbance or disorder (IRR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.49-0.89, p = 0.006). After the second dose, incidence rates of overall AESIs (IRR = 0.97, 95% CI 0.87-1.08, p = 0.545) and mortality (IRR = 0.85, 95% CI 0.51-1.40, p = 0.516) were comparable between CoronaVac and BNT162b2 recipients, with no significant differences observed for specific AESIs. The main limitations of this study include residual confounding due to its observational nature, and the possibility of its being underpowered for some AESIs with very low observed incidences.
In this study, we observed that the incidences of AESIs (cumulative incidence rate of 0.06%-0.09%) and mortality following the first and second doses of CoronaVac and BNT162b2 vaccination were very low. The safety profiles of the vaccines were generally comparable, except for a significantly higher incidence rate of Bell palsy, but lower incidence rates of anaphylaxis and sleeping disturbance or disorder, following first dose CoronaVac versus BNT162b2 vaccination. Our results could help inform the choice of inactivated COVID-19 vaccines, mainly administered in low- and middle-income countries with large populations, in comparison to the safety of mRNA vaccines.

During home visits, CHWs will remind patients of follow-up visits. We will measure blood pressure at baseline and 3-monthly for the entire cohort. We will conduct individual-level mixed effects analyses of study data, adjusting for time and clustering by patient and community.

The multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios [HRs; 95% confidence interval (CI)] for MACEs gradually and significantly increased with the AIP quartiles [1.113 (1.054-1.175) in Q2, 1.175 (1.113-1.240) in Q3, and 1.278 (1.209-1.350) in Q4], following an adjustment for the conventional CV risk factors, including age, sex, body mass index, smoking, alcohol drinking, physical activities, household income, fasting glucose, systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and estimated glomerular filtration rate. In subgroup analyses, the association of AIP with MACEs and CV events was particularly outstanding in patients with diabetes.
AIP was significantly associated with CV risks after adjusting for the traditional risk factors. Therefore, it may be used as an effective mass screening method to identify patients at a high risk of CV events.",Atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) is a marker for cardiovascular risk.,What is the relationship between AIP and cardiovascular diseases in a large-scale population dataset?,"Population dataset from Korean National Health Insurance Service, AIP quartiles analysis.","AIP was significantly associated with cardiovascular risks, particularly in patients with diabetes.","Observational study design, potential confounders not fully addressed."

Although obesity has been linked to accelerated epigenetic aging in middle-aged adults, the impact during childhood remains unclear. We tested the association between body mass index (BMI) and accelerated epigenetic aging in a cohort of high-risk children. Participants were children (N = 273, aged 8 to 14 years, 82% investigated for maltreatment) recruited to the Child Health Study, an ongoing prospective study of youth investigated for maltreatment and a comparison youth. BMI was measured as a continuous variable. Accelerated epigenetic aging of blood leukocytes was defined as the age-adjusted residuals of several established epigenetic aging clocks (Horvath, Hannum, GrimAge, PhenoAge) along with a newer algorithm, the DunedinPoAm, developed to quantify the pace-of-aging. Hypotheses were tested with generalized linear models. Higher age-and sex- adjusted z-scored BMI was significantly correlated with household income, blood cell counts, and three of the accelerated epigenetic aging measures: GrimAge (r = 0.31, P < .0001), PhenoAge (r = 0.24, P < .0001), and DunedinPoAm (r = 0.38, P < .0001). In fully adjusted models, GrimAge (β = 0.07; P = .0009) and DunedinPoAm (β = 0.0017; P < .0001) remained significantly associated with higher age- and sex-adjusted z-scored BMI. Maltreatment-status was not associated with accelerated epigenetic aging. In a high-risk cohort of children, higher BMI predicted epigenetic aging as assessed by two epigenetic aging clocks.

Retrospective interrupted time series analysis using SEER-18 database. All individuals with lung cancer (LC) diagnosis from 2006 to 2016 were included. The effect of NLST and CT-AP-2015 on the monthly percentage of early-stage ESLCD was the primary outcome, additionally LC incidence and mortality rates were calculated. The analysis was performed by age, sex, race, marital status, insurance status, and household income. Bivariate and multivariate models were used to identify predictors of ESLCD.
The study cohort was composed by 388,207 individuals, 69 years old in average, 46.6 % female, and 81.1 % white. LC incidence and mortality rates declined from 2006 to 2016 without association with NLST-September-2011 and CT-LCS-AP-February-2015. The percentage of ESLCD increased over time for all groups. Overall rates of ESLCD started at 18 % in January-2006 and increased to 25 % by December-2016. The intervention NLST-2011 did not show an impact in the ESLCD while the CT-AP-2015 showed a significant impact in the ESLCD trend (p < 0.001). ESLCD was associated with female, white, insurance, and household incomes above median. Medicare expansion was a significant factor for insured group, married patients and those from households under the median income level.
Medicare approval for CT screening was found to have a statistically significant effect on the diagnosis of early-stage lung cancer and neither NLST-September-2011 nor CT-AP-2015-February-2015 impacted the incidence nor mortality rates.

Adult survivors who experienced IHCA between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2018, and were alive for over 1 year after IHCA were included. Worsening QOL among IHCA survivors was determined using three criteria: decreased household income, unemployment, and acquired disability.
A total of 22,611 IHCA survivors from 903 hospitals were included in the final analysis, and 7,796 (34.5%) experienced worsening QOL. Specifically, 5,595 (24.7%), 1,694 (7.5%), and 1,617 (7.2%) survivors experienced decreased household income, unemployment, and acquired disability, respectively. The proportion of brain lesion disability increased from 6.3% to 10.8% after IHCA. In multivariable Cox regression, worsening QOL was not associated with 3-year all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.96, 1.11; P = 0.372).

Infection numbers, hospitalisation rates and mortality can be mitigated if large parts of the population are being vaccinated. However, one year after the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines, a substantial share of the Swiss population still refrains from being vaccinated.
We analysed COVID-19 vaccination uptake during the first 12 months of vaccine availability. We compared vaccination rates of different socioeconomic subgroups (e.g., education, income, migration background) and regions (urban vs rural, language region) and investigated associations between uptake and individual traits such as health literacy, adherence to COVID-19 prevention measures and trust in government or science.
Our analysis was based on self-reported vaccination uptake of a longitudinal online panel of Swiss adults aged 18 to 79 (the ""COVID-19 Social Monitor"", analysis sample n = 2448). The panel is representative for Switzerland with regard to age, gender, and language regions. Participants have been periodically surveyed about various public health issues from 30 March 2020, to 16 December 2021. We report uptake rates and age-stratified hazard ratios (HRs) by population subgroups without and with additional covariate adjustment using Cox regression survival analysis.
Higher uptake rates were found for individuals with more than just compulsory schooling (secondary: unadjusted HR 1.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.10-1.76; tertiary: HR 1.94, 95% CI 1.52-2.47), household income above CHF 4999 (5000-9999: unadj.

We aimed to explore the epidemiology of deaths among young children with acute illness across sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia to inform the development of interventions and improved guidelines.
In this prospective cohort study, we enrolled children aged 2-23 months with acute illness, stratified by nutritional status defined by anthropometry (ie, no wasting, moderate wasting, or severe wasting or kwashiorkor), who were admitted to one of nine hospitals in six countries across sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia between Nov 20, 2016, and Jan 31, 2019. We assisted sites to comply with national guidelines. Co-primary outcomes were mortality within 30 days of hospital admission and post-discharge mortality within 180 days of hospital discharge. A priori exposure domains, including demographic, clinical, and anthropometric characteristics at hospital admission and discharge, as well as child, caregiver, and household-level characteristics, were examined in regression and survival structural equation models.
Of 3101 children (median age 11 months [IQR 7-16]), 1120 (36·1%) had no wasting, 763 (24·6%) had moderate wasting, and 1218 (39·3%) had severe wasting or kwashiorkor. Of 350 (11·3%) deaths overall, 234 (66·9%) occurred within 30 days of hospital admission and 168 (48·0%) within 180 days of hospital discharge. 90 (53·6%) post-discharge deaths occurred at home. The proportion of children who died following discharge was relatively preserved across nutritional strata. Numerically large high-risk and low-risk groups could be disaggregated for early mortality and post-discharge mortality. Structural equation models identified direct pathways to mortality and multiple socioeconomic, clinical, and nutritional domains acting indirectly through anthropometric status.
Among diverse sites in Africa and south Asia, almost half of mortality occurs following hospital discharge. Despite being highly predictable, these deaths are not addressed in current guidelines. A fundamental shift to a child-centred, risk-based approach to inpatient and post-discharge management is needed to further reduce childhood mortality, and clinical trials of these approaches with outcomes of mortality, readmission, and cost are warranted.

The aims of this study were to determine the incidence and associations with neonatal sepsis and all-cause mortality in facility-born neonates in LMICs.
The Burden of Antibiotic Resistance in Neonates from Developing Societies (BARNARDS) study recruited mothers and their neonates into a prospective observational cohort study across 12 clinical sites from Bangladesh, Ethiopia, India, Pakistan, Nigeria, Rwanda, and South Africa. Data for sepsis-associated factors in the four domains of health care, maternal, birth and neonatal, and living environment were collected for all mothers and neonates enrolled. Primary outcomes were clinically suspected sepsis, laboratory-confirmed sepsis, and all-cause mortality in neonates during the first 60 days of life. Incidence proportion of livebirths for clinically suspected sepsis and laboratory-confirmed sepsis and incidence rate per 1000 neonate-days for all-cause mortality were calculated. Modified Poisson regression was used to investigate factors associated with neonatal sepsis and parametric survival models for factors associated with all-cause mortality.
Between Nov 12, 2015 and Feb 1, 2018, 29 483 mothers and 30 557 neonates were enrolled. The incidence of clinically suspected sepsis was 166·0 (95% CI 97·69-234·24) per 1000 livebirths, laboratory-confirmed sepsis was 46·9 (19·04-74·79) per 1000 livebirths, and all-cause mortality was 0·83 (0·37-2·00) per 1000 neonate-days. Maternal hypertension, previous maternal hospitalisation within 12 months, average or higher monthly household income, ward size (>11 beds), ward type (neonatal), living in a rural environment, preterm birth, perinatal asphyxia, and multiple births were associated with an increased risk of clinically suspected sepsis, laboratory-confirmed sepsis, and all-cause mortality. The majority (881 [72·5%] of 1215) of laboratory-confirmed sepsis cases occurred within the first 3 days of life.
Findings from this study highlight the substantial proportion of neonates who develop neonatal sepsis, and the high mortality rates among neonates with sepsis in LMICs. More efficient and effective identification of neonatal sepsis is needed to target interventions to reduce its incidence and subsequent mortality in LMICs.

To investigate the joint associations of race, ethnicity, and neighborhood and individual socioeconomic status with mortality.
This prospective analysis used data from the Multiethnic Cohort Study. A population-based sample of participants recruited from California (mainly Los Angeles County) and Hawaii from 1993 to 1996 was followed up until 2013. African American, European American, Japanese American, Latino American, and Native Hawaiian men and women were included. Participants with baseline residential addresses that could not be geocoded or who were missing information on education or adjustment variables were excluded. Data analyses were conducted from January 2018 to December 2020.
Neighborhood socioeconomic status (nSES) was derived using US Census block group data on education, occupation, unemployment, household income, poverty, rent, and house values. Participants self-reported their highest education attainment. Five racial and ethnic groups, 2 states of residence, 2 nSES, and 2 education categories were combined to create a joint exposure variable. Low and high nSES were defined as quintiles 1 to 3 and 4 to 5, respectively. Low and high education levels were defined as high school or less and greater than high school graduate, respectively.
All-cause, cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, and non-CVD and noncancer deaths were ascertained through 2013 via linkage to death certificates and the US National Death Index. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were conducted.
Among 182 912 participants (100 785 [55.1%] women and 82 127 [44.9%] men; mean [SD] age, 60.0 [8.9] years; 31 138 African American, 45 796 European American, 52 993 Japanese American, 39 844 Latino American, and 13 141 Native Hawaiian participants) with a mean (SD) follow-up of 17 (5) years, there were 63 799 total deaths, including 23 191 CVD deaths, 19 008 cancer deaths, and 21 235 non-CVD and noncancer deaths. The lowest all-cause mortality was found among 15 104 Japanese American participants in Hawaii with high nSES and high education (eg, 2870 all-cause deaths [19.0%]), and this population served as the reference group for all regression analyses. Native Hawaiian participants in Hawaii with low nSES and low education had the highest all-cause mortality HR (2.38; 95% CI, 2.21-2.57). African American and European American participants in California with low nSES and low education had the next highest all-cause mortality HRs (2.01; 95% CI, 1.91-2.11 and 1.98; 95% CI, 1.85-2.12, respectively). Latino American participants in California with low nSES had equivalent all-cause mortality HRs regardless of education level (high education: 1.57; 95% CI, 1.48-1.66; low education: 1.57; 95% CI, 1.50-1.65). Patterns for cause-specific mortality were similar to those for all-cause mortality. For example, Native Hawaiian participants in Hawaii with low nSES and low education had highest CVD mortality HR (2.92; 95% CI, 2.60-3.27) and cancer mortality HR (2.01; 95% CI, 1.77-2.29).
These results suggest that joint associations of nSES and education may further delineate racial and ethnic inequities in mortality and that future investigations of racial and ethnic inequities in mortality should consider differences by measures of socioeconomic status, especially for underserved populations.",,,,,

CS is associated with significant mortality. There is increasing use of temporary MCS devices in CS, and its impact on outcomes is currently under investigation. There is a lack of data on the effect of SES on the utilization of MCS devices in CS.
CS hospitalizations were obtained from the State Inpatient Databases in 2016 from 9 states representing various regions in the United States. The study had exempt institutional review board status as the database includes deidentified data. Hospitalizations were separated into SES cohorts based on the median household income of the patient residence zip code. Utilization of MCS devices and revascularization procedures along with clinical outcomes with CS were compared across the quartiles.
There were 38,520 hospitalizations identified with CS, 42.6% of which were secondary to acute myocardial infarction. Patients from higher SES areas were significantly older but had lower burden of comorbidities. Utilization of temporary MCS devices was higher for hospitalizations from higher SES regions (frequency from the lowest SES quartile to the highest SES quartile: 21.3%, 21.5%, 23.5, and 24.1%, 
Higher SES regions had increased use of temporary MCS. There was no difference in mortality between SES cohorts.",,,,,

The relative effectiveness of UCTs compared with conditional cash transfers (CCTs; provided only if recipients follow prescribed behaviours, e.g. use a health service or attend school) is unknown.
To assess the effects of UCTs on health services use and health outcomes in children and adults in LMICs. Secondary objectives are to assess the effects of UCTs on social determinants of health and healthcare expenditure, and to compare the effects of UCTs versus CCTs.
For this update, we searched 15 electronic academic databases, including CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EconLit, in September 2021. We also searched four electronic grey literature databases, websites of key organisations and reference lists of previous systematic reviews, key journals and included study records.
We included both parallel-group and cluster-randomised controlled trials (C-RCTs), quasi-RCTs, cohort studies, controlled before-and-after studies (CBAs), and interrupted time series studies of UCT interventions in children (0 to 17 years) and adults (≥ 18 years) in LMICs. Comparison groups received either no UCT, a smaller UCT or a CCT. Our primary outcomes were any health services use or health outcome.
Two review authors independently screened potentially relevant records for inclusion, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We obtained missing data from study authors if feasible. For C-RCTs, we generally calculated risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes from crude frequency measures in approximately correct analyses. Meta-analyses applied the inverse variance or Mantel-Haenszel method using a random-effects model. Where meta-analysis was impossible, we synthesised results using vote counting based on effect direction. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.
We included 34 studies (25 studies of 20 C-RCTs, six CBAs, and three cohort studies) involving 1,140,385 participants (45,538 children, 1,094,847 adults) and 50,095 households in Africa, the Americas and South-East Asia in our meta-analyses and narrative syntheses. These analysed 29 independent data sets. The 24 UCTs identified, including one basic universal income intervention, were pilot or established government programmes or research experiments. The cash value was equivalent to 1.3% to 81.9% of the annualised gross domestic product per capita. All studies compared a UCT with no UCT; three studies also compared a UCT with a CCT. Most studies carried an overall high risk of bias (i.e. often selection or performance bias, or both). Most studies were funded by national governments or international organisations, or both. Throughout the review, we use the words 'probably' to indicate moderate-certainty evidence, 'may/maybe' for low-certainty evidence, and 'uncertain' for very low-certainty evidence. Health services use We assumed greater use of any health services to be beneficial. UCTs may not have impacted the likelihood of having used any health service in the previous 1 to 12 months, when participants were followed up between 12 and 24 months into the intervention (risk ratio (RR) 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00 to 1.09; I
This body of evidence suggests that unconditional cash transfers (UCTs) may not impact a summary measure of health service use in children and adults in LMICs. However, UCTs probably or may improve some health outcomes (i.e. the likelihood of having had any illness, the likelihood of having been food secure, and the level of dietary diversity), two social determinants of health (i.e. the likelihoods of attending school and being extremely poor), and healthcare expenditure.

Using over four decades of follow-up data on 36,717 couples from Jerusalem (1964-2016), we compared heterogamous with homogamous couples.
Having a less educated spouse was associated with an increased risk for several outcomes in both genders, such as all-cause mortality in males (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.18, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.12, 1.25) and in females (HR = 1.11, CI: 1.01, 1.22). Having a more educated spouse was associated with decreased all-cause mortality in males (HR = 0.93, CI: 0.87, 0.99), but not in females. Having an older spouse was detrimental for health of both genders. For example, increased all-cause mortality was seen in men (HR = 1.22, CI: 1.10, 1.34) and in women (HR = 1.10, CI: 1.02, 1.19). A younger spouse was beneficial for some of the outcomes in males, such as decreased cancer-specific mortality (HR = 0.88, CI: 0.78, 0.99), but not in females.

SLE outcomes also seem to be influenced by socioeconomic factors. Neuropsychiatric lupus (NPL) is a common manifestation of SLE that is difficult to diagnose and treat and has poor clinical outcomes. There is no clear relationship between NPL and SLE-related autoantibodies, and this contributes to the difficulty in diagnosing NPL. As a result, NPL is a significant contributor to morbidity and mortality in patients with SLE. Objective The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between serological and socioeconomic factors in the development of NPL in our patient cohort and determine the risk factors for the development of NPL. Methods This was an SLE single-center, retrospective chart review study that was performed at a university-based tertiary referral center. Patients aged 18 and older who meet the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1997 criteria and were seen between June 1st, 2015, and June 1st, 2019, were included in this study. Overall, 629 patients with SLE were identified, and 263 patients were included. Demographic and serological data were collected. Supplemental socioeconomic information for each zip code in Southwest Virginia was obtained from the United States Government Census website. Continuous variables were analyzed using the T-test or Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables were analyzed using chi-square tests or Fisher's exact tests. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS9.4, and p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results We reviewed a number of risk factors including age, sex, race, and median household income (MHI), noting no statistical relationship between these factors and the diagnosis of NPL. We did find that the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) was significantly associated with a diagnosis of NPL and that complement 4 (C4) levels trended toward statistical significance. Conclusion In our cohort of patients, there was no relationship between age, sex, race, and median household income, and the diagnosis of NPL.

Research into the impact of gender on neurosurgical outcomes remains limited. The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of gender on outcomes, in a matched sample, following posterior fossa tumor resection, a high-risk neurosurgical procedure. Methods Two hundred seventy-eight consecutive patients undergoing posterior fossa tumor resection over a six-year period (June 07, 2013, to April 29, 2019) at a single academic medical system were retrospectively evaluated. Short-term outcomes included 30- and 90-day rates of emergency department (ED) visit, readmission, reoperation, and mortality. Long-term outcomes included mortality and reoperation for the duration of follow-up. Firstly, male and female patients in the entire pre-match sample were compared. Thereafter, coarsened exact matching was employed to control for confounding variables, matching male and female patients on key demographic factors - including history of prior surgery, median household income, and race, amongst others - and outcome comparison was repeated. Results In both the entire pre-match sample and matched cohort analyses, no significant differences in adverse postsurgical events were discerned between the female and male patients when evaluating 30-day or 90-day rates of ED visit, readmission, reoperation, and mortality. There were also no differences in reoperation or mortality for the duration of follow-up.

We used the National Health Insurance Service database with 4,989,351 children born from 2002 to 2012 including 35,529 children diagnosed with ASD until 8 years of age. The 8-year cumulative prevalence of ASD was calculated annually (2010-2020) with 8 years of follow-up. The 8-year mortality was estimated using Cox models adjusted for sex, household income, area of residence, and year of birth.
Of the 473,494 children born in 2002, 2,467 (5.2 per 1,000 births) were diagnosed with ASD until 2010. The ASD prevalence was 2.6 times higher among boys (1,839; 7.4 per 1,000 boy births) than girls (628; 2.8 per 1,000 girl births). Of the 467,360 children born in 2012, 4,378 (9.4 per 1,000 births) were diagnosed with ASD until 2020. The ASD prevalence was 2.7 times higher among boys (3,246; 13.5 per 1,000 boy births) than girls (1,132; 5.0 per 1,000 girl births). The risk of all-cause mortality was higher among children with ASD than those without (hazard ratio [HR], 2.340; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.063-2.654), which is substantially higher among girls (HR, 4.223; 95% CI, 3.472-5.135) than boys (HR, 1.774; 95% CI, 1.505-2.090).
The present study demonstrated that national-level prevalence and mortality statistics of ASD can be estimated effectively using claims data comprising newborns born each year and followed up for to the age of interest. Because this information is essential to establish evidence-based policies, health authorities need to consider producing epidemiological information of ASD continuously using the same methodology.",Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) prevalence is increasing.,What are the prevalence and mortality statistics of ASD according to birth year?,"Nationwide cohort study using health insurance data, assessing ASD prevalence and mortality over time.","ASD prevalence was higher among boys, and all-cause mortality was elevated in children with ASD.","Focused on a specific population, findings may not apply universally."

Variation in COVID-19 pandemic eviction protections across US states enables identification of intervention targets within the eviction process to improve renters' mental health.
To measure the association between the strength of eviction protections (ie, stages blocked by eviction moratoriums) and mental distress among renters during the COVID-19 pandemic.
This cohort study used individual-level, nationally representative data from the Understanding Coronavirus in America Survey to measure associations between state eviction moratorium protections and mental distress. The sample of 2317 respondents included renters with annual household incomes less than $75 000 who reported a state of residence and completed surveys between March 10 and September 3, 2020, prior to the federal eviction moratorium order by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Time-varying strength of state moratorium protections as a categorical variable: none, weak (blocking court hearings, judgments, or enforcement without blocking notice or filing), or strong (blocking all stages of the eviction process beginning with notice and filing).
Moderate to severe mental distress was measured using the 4-item Patient Health Questionnaire. Linear regression models were adjusted for time-varying state COVID-19 incidence and mortality, public health restrictions, and unemployment rates. Models included individual and time fixed effects as well as clustered standard errors.
The sample consisted of 2317 individuals (20 853 total observations) composed largely (1788 [78%] weighted) of middle-aged adults (25-64 years of age) and women (1538 [60%]); 640 respondents (23%) self-reported as Hispanic or Latinx, 314 respondents (20%) as non-Hispanic Black, and 1071 respondents (48%) as non-Hispanic White race and ethnicity. Relative to no state-level eviction moratorium protections, strong protections were associated with a 12.6% relative reduction (risk ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.76-0.99) in the probability of mental distress, whereas weak protections were not associated with a statistically significant reduction (risk ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.86-1.06).
This analysis of the Understanding Coronavirus in America Survey data found that strong eviction moratoriums were associated with protection against mental distress, suggesting that distress begins early in the eviction process with notice and filing. This finding is consistent with the idea that to reduce mental distress among renters, policy makers should focus on primary prevention of evictions.",Neighborhood and individual SES impact cancer care and outcomes.,How do neighborhood and individual SES affect survival in nonmetastatic common cancers?,Prospective cohort study using a comprehensive composite measure of neighborhood SES and individual SES.,"Neighborhood-level deprivation was associated with worse survival, independent of individual SES.","Focused on specific cancer types and SES measures, may not apply broadly."

However, independent or synergistic associations between neighborhood and individual socioeconomic disadvantage have not been fully examined, and prior studies using simplistic neighborhood SES measures may not comprehensively assess multiple aspects of neighborhood SES.
To investigate the associations of neighborhood SES (using a validated comprehensive composite measure) and individual SES with survival among patients with nonmetastatic common cancers.
This prospective, population-based cohort study was derived from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database from January 1, 2008, through December 31, 2011, with follow-up ending on December 31, 2017. Participants included older patients (≥65 years) with breast, prostate, lung, or colorectal cancer.
Neighborhood SES was measured using the area deprivation index (ADI; quintiles), a validated comprehensive composite measure of neighborhood SES. Individual SES was assessed by Medicare-Medicaid dual eligibility (yes vs no), a reliable indicator for patient-level low income.
The primary outcome was overall mortality, and the secondary outcome was cancer-specific mortality. Hazard ratios (HRs) for the associations of ADI and dual eligibility with overall and cancer-specific mortality were estimated via Cox proportional hazards regression. Statistical analyses were conducted from January 23 to April 15, 2021.
A total of 96 978 patients were analyzed, including 25 968 with breast, 35 150 with prostate, 16 684 with lung, and 19 176 with colorectal cancer. Median age at diagnosis was 76 years (IQR, 71-81 years) for breast cancer, 73 years (IQR, 70-77 years) for prostate cancer, 76 years (IQR, 71-81 years) for lung cancer, and 78 years (IQR, 72-84 years) for colorectal cancer. Among lung and colorectal cancer patients, 8412 (50.4%) and 10 486 (54.7%), respectively, were female. The proportion of non-Hispanic White individuals among breast cancer patients was 83.7% (n = 21 725); prostate cancer, 76.8% (n = 27 001); lung cancer, 83.5% (n = 13 926); and colorectal cancer, 81.1% (n = 15 557). Neighborhood-level and individual-level SES were independently associated with overall mortality, and no interactions were detected. Compared with the most affluent neighborhoods (ADI quintile 1), living in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods (ADI quintile 5) was associated with higher risk of overall mortality (breast: HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.26-1.43; prostate: HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.42-1.62; lung: HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.14-1.28; and colorectal: HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.17-1.32). Individual socioeconomic disadvantage (dual eligibility) was associated with higher risk of overall mortality (breast: HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.15-1.29; prostate: HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.21-1.38; lung: HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.09-1.20; and colorectal: HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.17-1.29). A similar pattern was observed for cancer-specific mortality.
In this cohort study, neighborhood-level deprivation was associated with worse survival among patients with nonmetastatic breast, prostate, lung, and colorectal cancer, even after accounting for individual SES.

We aim to assess the risk of IaVI's across these characteristics.
Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample for the years 2008 to 2015, we identified rates of IaVI's among the top ten most frequently performed inpatient procedures in the United States. Joint point regression was employed to examine the trends in the rates of IaVI's. We also calculated the adjusted odds ratios for IaVI's using survey logistic regression.
During the eight-year study period, a total of 29,877,180 procedures were performed (33.6% hip replacement, 14% knee arthroplasty, 11.2% cholecystectomy, 10.3% spinal fusion, 8.9% lysis of adhesions, 8% colorectal resection, 7.9% partial bone excision, 5% appendectomy, 0.6% percutaneous coronary angioplasty, 0.6% laminectomy). A total of 194,031 (0.65%) IaVI's were associated with these procedures. The incidence of IaVI's increased over time with an average annual percentage change (AAPC) of 4.2% (95% CI: 3.1, 5.4; P < 0.01). More females (105,747; 54.5%) than males (88,284; 45.5%) suffered IaVI's during their hospital admission (P < 0.01). Patients 70 years of age and older had the highest incidence of IaVI's (12,244,082; 34.3%; P ≤ 0.01). Among the ten index procedures, Non-Hispanic (NH) Whites underwent the highest proportion of procedures (14.1 procedures/100 hospitalizations; P < 0.01) and cholecystectomy was associated with the highest rate of IaVI's (19.4 per 1000 hospitalizations, P ≤ 0.01). Overall, patients from the lowest income quartile were least likely to suffer IaVI's (0.83 95% CI 0.79-0.88, P < 0.01) compared to the highest income quartile. All form of healthcare coverage increased the odds of IaVI's: Medicaid (1.07 95% CI 1.07-1.13, P < 0.01); Private insurance (1.35 95% CI 1.3-1.39, P < 0.01); Self-pay or no charge (1.45 95% CI 1.38-1.52, P < 0.01). IaVI's increased the odds of in-hospital mortality in all groups (1.25 95% CI 1.14-1.35, P < 0.01) and more pronounced in NH-Blacks (1.51 95% CI 1.15-1.99, P < 0.01). In the overall cohort, urban teaching hospitals observed the highest odds of in-hospital mortality (1.11 95% CI 1.07-1.15, P < 0.01).
Between 2008 to 2015, IaVI's rates for the top ten most frequently performed inpatient procedures increased by 33.6% (4.2% annually; P < 0.01). The elderly, females, and Hispanics more frequently had hospitalizations complicated by IaVI's. Overall, IaVI's independently increased the adjusted odds of mortality by 25%. IaVI's were most fatal among Blacks, about 50% elevated risk of death compared to NH-Whites. These benchmarks will be critical to future efforts to reduce IaVI, and associated healthcare disparities.",,,,,

We established the prospective Rural Uganda Non-Communicable Disease (RUNCD) cohort to longitudinally characterize the NCD prevalence, progression, and complications in rural Africa.
We conducted a population-based census for NCD research. We systematically enrolled adults in each household among three sub-counties of the larger Nakaseke Health district and collected baseline demographic, health status, and self-reported chronic disease information. We present our data on self-reported chronic disease, as stratified by age, sex, educational attainment, and sub-county.
A total of 16,694 adults were surveyed with 10,563 (63%) respondents enrolled in the self-reported study. Average age was 37.8 years (SD = 16.5) and 45% (7481) were male. Among self-reported diseases, hypertension (HTN) was most prevalent (6.3%). 1.1% of participants reported a diagnosis of diabetes, 1.1% asthma, 0.7% COPD, and 0.4% kidney disease. 2.4% of the population described more than one NCD. Self-reported HTN was significantly higher in the peri-urban subcounty than in the other two rural sub-counties (p < 0.001); diagnoses for all other diseases did not differ significantly between sub-counties. Odds for self-reported HTN increased significantly with age (OR = 1.87 per 10 years of age, 95% CI 1.78-1.96). Male sex was associated with lower odds of reporting asthma (OR = 0.53, 95% CI 0.34-0.82) or HTN (OR = 0.31, 95% CI 0.26-0.40).
The RUNCD will establish one of the largest NCD patient cohorts in rural Africa. First analysis highlights the feasibility of systematically enrolling large numbers of adults living in a rural Ugandan district. In addition, our study demonstrates low levels of self-reported NCDs compared to the nation-wide established levels, emphasizing the need to better educate, characterize, and care for the majority of rural communities.",,,,,

Housing is a fundamental social determinant of health. Yet, little is known about the impacts of liveable residential space and density on hypertension.
This retrospective observational study (median follow-up of 2.2 years) leveraged the FAMILY Cohort, a large territory-wide cohort in Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region, People's Republic of China to quantify associations of objectively measured liveable space and residential density with blood pressure outcomes among adults aged ≥16 years. Blood pressure outcomes comprised diastolic blood pressure (DBP), systolic blood pressure (SBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and hypertension. Liveable space was measured as residential floor area, and density was assessed using the number of residential units per building block and neighborhood residential unit density within predefined catchments. Multivariable regression models examined associations of liveable floor area and residential density with prevalent and incident hypertension. We investigated effect modifications by age, sex, income, employment status, and housing type. Propensity score matching was further employed to match a subset of participants who moved to smaller residences at follow-up with equivalent controls who did not move, and generalized linear models examined the impact of moving to smaller residences upon blood pressure outcomes. Our fully adjusted models of prevalent hypertension outcomes comprised 30,439 participants at baseline, while 13,895 participants were available for incident models at follow-up. We found that each interquartile range (IQR) increment in liveable floor area was associated with lower DBP (beta [β] = -0.269 mm Hg, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.419 to -0.118, p < 0.001), SBP (β = -0.317 mm Hg, -0.551 to -0.084, p = 0.008), MAP (β = -0.285 mm Hg, -0.451 to -0.119 with p < 0.001), and prevalent hypertension (odds ratio [OR] = 0.955, 0.918 to 0.993, p = 0.022) at baseline. Each IQR increment in residential units per building block was associated with higher DBP (β = 0.477 mm Hg, 0.212 to 0.742, p = <0.001), SBP (β = 0.750 mm Hg, 0.322 to 1.177, p = <0.001), MAP (β = 0.568 mm Hg, 0.269 to 0.866, p < 0.001), and prevalent hypertension (OR = 1.091, 1.024 to 1.162, p = 0.007). Each IQR increase in neighborhood residential density within 0.5-mi street catchment was associated with lower DBP (β = -0.289 mm Hg, -0.441 to -0.137, p = <0.001), SBP (β = -0.411 mm Hg, -0.655 to -0.168, p < 0.001), MAP (β = -0.330 mm Hg, -0.501 to -0.159, p = <0.001), and lower prevalent hypertension (OR = 0.933, 0.899 to 0.969, p < 0.001). In the longitudinal analyses, each IQR increment in liveable floor area was associated with lower DBP (β = -0.237 mm Hg, -0.431 to -0.043, p = 0.016), MAP (β = -0.244 mm Hg, -0.444 to -0.043, p = 0.017), and incident hypertension (adjusted OR = 0.909, 0.836 to 0.988, p = 0.025). The inverse associations between larger liveable area and blood pressure outcomes were more pronounced among women and those residing in public housing. In the propensity-matched analysis, participants moving to residences of lower liveable floor area were associated with higher odds of incident hypertension in reference to those who did not move (OR = 1.623, 1.173 to 2.199, p = 0.002). The major limitations of the study are unmeasured residual confounding and loss to follow-up.
We disentangled the association of micro-, meso-, and macrolevel residential densities with hypertension and found that higher liveable floor area and neighborhood scale residential density were associated with lower odds of hypertension. These findings suggest adequate housing in the form of provisioning of sufficient liveable space and optimizing residential density at the building block, and neighborhood levels should be investigated as a potential population-wide preventive strategy for lowering hypertension and associated chronic diseases.",,,,,

This is a comparative study that retrospectively queried the National Inpatient Sample, a hospital-based inpatient database in the USA. The study cohort was women diagnosed with PAS who underwent cesarean delivery from 10/2015 to 12/2018. The exposure group was race/ethnicity. Main outcomes were (i) patient/pregnancy characteristics and (ii) surgical morbidity for cesarean delivery, assessed in multivariable analysis. A total of 10,535 women comprised the study cohort (White n = 5,230 [49.6%], Black n = 2,045 [19.4%], Hispanic n = 2,540 [24.1%], and Asian n = 720 [6.8%]). Patient demographics, pregnancy characteristics, and hospital factors for the non-White groups significantly differed compared to the White group. Older age, obesity, diabetes, placenta previa, percreta, non-elective surgery, lower median household income, and Medicaid particularly represented the non-White groups. When perioperative outcomes were compared, non-White women were more likely to have any measured complications, hemorrhage/transfusion, and shock/coagulopathy compared to White women. Various sensitivity analyses redemonstrated the main cohort results. In conclusion, this study suggests that there were significant disparities in patient characteristics and outcomes of women with PAS across race/ethnicity.",,,,,

PRISMA 2009 guidelines were used for this systematic review. The inclusion criteria were quantitative, peer reviewed journal articles published within a date range of May 1, 2013-June 12, 2021 examining birth outcomes related to household air pollution from type of cooking fuel in low- and middle-income countries. The quality of available evidence was evaluated using the Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) risk of bias rating tool. Of the 553 studies screened, 23 satisfied the inclusion criteria. Of the studies that met the inclusion criteria, 14 were cross-sectional, 5 cohort, 1 case-control and 3 randomized control trials conducted across 15 different countries. A range of birth outcomes are reported across studies including birthweight (19), small for gestational age (6), spontaneous abortion (3), preterm birth (6), stillbirth (7) and neonatal mortality (6). The reviewed studies presented evidence for an increased risk of low birth weight (LBW), preterm birth (PTB), small for gestational age (SGA), stillbirth, neonatal mortality and reduction in birthweight with solid fuel and kerosene use compared to cleaner fuels like gas and LPG. Systematically reviewing the evidence and risk of bias ratings illuminated several gaps in the current literature related to exposure assessment, outcome measurement and adequacy of adjustment for confounding.",,,,,

A cohort of 12,506 relatively 'healthy' community-dwelling Australians aged ≥ 70 years (54.4% females), enrolled in the ASPREE Longitudinal Study of Older Persons (ALSOP) study and was followed for six years. Economic factors, social health and life events in the last 12 months were assessed through a questionnaire at baseline. Physical HRQoL was measured by using the 12-item short form at baseline and annual follow-ups. Growth mixture and structural equation modelling were used to identify physical HRQoL trajectories and their predictors.
Four physical HRQoL trajectories were identified-stable low (7.1%), declining (9.0%), stable intermediate (17.9%) and stable high (66.0%). Living in more disadvantaged areas, having a lower household income, no paid work, no voluntary work, loneliness and stressful life events (i.e. spousal illness, friend/family illness, financial problem) were associated with a 10%-152% higher likelihood of being in the stable low or declining physical HRQoL trajectory than the stable high group.

However, little is known about how suicide risk among people diagnosed with cancer might vary according to area-level income and rurality.
To examine whether the risks and patterns of suicide mortality among people with a cancer diagnosis differ by US county-level median income and rural or urban status.
A retrospective, population-based cohort study following up individuals who were diagnosed with cancer between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2016, was conducted. The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program 18 registries (SEER 18) database was used to obtain data on persons diagnosed with a first primary malignant tumor. Comparisons with the general US population were based on mortality data collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. Analyses were conducted from February 22 to October 14, 2020.
County-level median household income and urban or rural status.
Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) of suicide deaths and annual percentage changes (APCs) of SMRs.
The SEER 18 database included 5 362 782 persons with cancer diagnoses living in 635 counties. Most study participants were men (51.2%), White (72.2%), and older than 65 years (49.7%). Among them, 6357 persons died of suicide (SMR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.38-1.44). People with cancer living in the lowest-income counties had a significantly higher risk (SMR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.76-2.13) than those in the highest-income counties (SMR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.26-1.34). Those living in rural counties also had significantly higher SMR than those in urban counties (SMR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.70-1.92 vs SMR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.32-1.39). For all county groups, the SMRs were the highest within the first year following cancer diagnosis. However, among people living in the lowest-income counties, the risk remained significantly high even after 10 or more years following cancer diagnosis (SMR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.31-2.48). The comparative risk of suicide mortality within 1 year following cancer diagnosis significantly decreased over the years but then plateaued in the highest-income (2005-2015: APC, 2.03%; 95% CI, -0.97% to 5.13%), lowest-income (2010-2015: APC, 4.80%; 95% CI, -19.97% to 37.24%), and rural (2004-2015: APC, 1.83; 95% CI, -1.98% to 5.79%) counties.

Whether pPCI confers a benefit to patients receiving dialysis that is similar to that which occurs in lower-risk groups remains unknown. We compared the effect of pPCI on in-hospital outcomes among patients hospitalized for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and receiving maintenance dialysis with the effect among patients hospitalized for STEMI but not receiving dialysis.
Retrospective cohort study.
We used the National Inpatient Sample (2016-2018) and included all adult hospitalizations with a primary diagnosis of STEMI.
Primary exposure was PCI. Confounders included dialysis status, demographics, insurance, household income, comorbidities, and the elective nature of the admission.
In-hospital mortality, stroke, acute kidney injury, new dialysis requirement, vascular complications, gastrointestinal bleeding, blood transfusion, mechanical ventilation, palliative care, and discharge destination.
The average treatment effect (ATE) of pPCI was estimated using propensity score matching independently within the group receiving dialysis and the group not receiving dialysis to explore whether the effect is modified by dialysis status. Additionally, the average marginal effect (AME) was calculated accounting for the clustering within hospitals.
Among hospitalizations, 4,220 (1.07%) out of 413,500 were for patients receiving dialysis. The dialysis cohort was older (65.2 ± 12.2 vs 63.4 ± 13.1, P < 0.001), had a higher proportion of women (42.4% vs 30.6%, P < 0.001) and more comorbidities, and had a lower proportion of White patients (41.1% vs 71.7%, P < 0.001). Patients receiving dialysis were less likely to undergo angiography (73.1% vs 85.4%, P < 0.001) or pPCI (57.5% vs 79.8%, P < 0.001). Primary PCI was associated with lower mortality in patients receiving dialysis (15.7% vs 27.1%, P < 0.001) as well as in those who were not (5.0% vs 17.4%, P < 0.001). The ATE on mortality did not differ significantly (P interaction = 0.9) between patients receiving dialysis (-8.6% [95% CI, -15.6% to -1.6%], P = 0.02) and those who were not (-8.2% [95% CI, -8.8% to -7.5%], P < 0.001).

We estimated the global burden of low birth weight (LBW) and preterm birth (PTB) and impacts on reduced birth weight and gestational age (GA), attributable to ambient and household PM2.5 pollution in 2019.
We searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science for peer-reviewed articles in English. Study quality was assessed using 2 tools: (1) Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality checklist; and (2) National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) risk of bias questions. We conducted a meta-regression (MR) to quantify the risk of PM2.5 on birth weight and GA. The MR, based on a systematic review (SR) of articles published through April 4, 2021, and resulting uncertainty intervals (UIs) accounted for unexplained between-study heterogeneity. Separate nonlinear relationships relating exposure to risk were generated for each outcome and applied in the burden estimation. The MR included 44, 40, and 40 birth weight, LBW, and PTB studies, respectively. Majority of the studies were of retrospective cohort design and primarily from North America, Europe, and Australia. A few recent studies were from China, India, sub-Saharan Africa, and South America. Pooled estimates indicated 22 grams (95% UI: 12, 32) lower birth weight, 11% greater risk of LBW (1.11, 95% UI: 1.07, 1.16), and 12% greater risk of PTB (1.12, 95% UI: 1.06, 1.19), per 10 μg/m3 increment in ambient PM2.5. We estimated a global population-weighted mean lowering of 89 grams (95% UI: 88, 89) of birth weight and 3.4 weeks (95% UI: 3.4, 3.4) of GA in 2019, attributable to total PM2.5. Globally, an estimated 15.6% (95% UI: 15.6, 15.7) of all LBW and 35.7% (95% UI: 35.6, 35.9) of all PTB infants were attributable to total PM2.5, equivalent to 2,761,720 (95% UI: 2,746,713 to 2,776,722) and 5,870,103 (95% UI: 5,848,046 to 5,892,166) infants in 2019, respectively. About one-third of the total PM2.5 burden for LBW and PTB could be attributable to ambient exposure, with household air pollution (HAP) dominating in low-income countries. The findings should be viewed in light of some limitations such as heterogeneity between studies including size, exposure levels, exposure assessment method, and adjustment for confounding. Furthermore, studies did not separate the direct effect of PM2.5 on birth weight from that mediated through GA. As a consequence, the pooled risk estimates in the MR and likewise the global burden may have been underestimated.

Cooking with solid fuels, such as charcoal and wood, in low- and middle-income countries generates very high emissions of particulate matter within and near the household as a result of their inefficient combustion. Women are especially exposed, as they often perform the cooking. The purpose of this study was to assess the burden of disease attributable to household air pollution exposure from cooking among women in Adama, Ethiopia.
AirQ+ software (WHO Regional Office for Europe, Copenhagen, Denmark) was used to assess the health impact of household air pollution by estimating the burden of disease (BoD) including Acute Lower Respiratory Infections (ALRI), Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD), lung cancer, and stroke, among a cohort of women in Adama. Household air pollution exposure estimated by cooking fuel type was assessed through questionnaires.
Three-quarters (75%) of Adama's population used solid fuel for cooking; with this, the household air pollution attributable mortality was estimated to be 50% (95% CI: 38-58%) due to ALRI, 50% (95% CI: 35-61%) due to COPD, 50% (95% CI: 27-58%) due to lung cancer, (95% CI: 23-48%) due to IHD, and (95% CI: 23-51%) due to stroke. The corresponding disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) per 100,000 women ranged between 6000 and 9000 per disease.
This health impact assessment illustrates that household air pollution due to solid fuel use among women in Adama leads to premature death and a substantial quantity of DALYs. Therefore, decreasing or eliminating solid fuel use for cooking purposes could prevent deaths and improve quality of life.",Cooking with solid fuels in low- and middle-income countries leads to high emissions of particulate matter and health risks.,"What is the burden of disease attributable to household air pollution exposure from cooking among women in Adama, Ethiopia?","Used AirQ+ software to assess health impact, estimating burden of disease including ALRI, COPD, IHD, lung cancer, and stroke.",Household air pollution exposure led to premature death and substantial DALYs among women in Adama.,"Relied on questionnaires for exposure assessment, potential recall bias, and limited generalizability."

In the country's rural areas, more than half the population still relies on biomass fuels and coals for cooking and heating. Understanding the health impact of indoor air pollution and socioeconomic indicators is essential for the country to improve its developmental targets. We aimed to describe demographic and socioeconomic characteristics associated with solid fuel users in a rural area in China. We also estimated the risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality in association with solid fuel use and described the relationship between solid fuel use, socioeconomic status and mortality. We also measured the risk of long-term use, and the effect of ameliorative action, on mortality caused by cardiovascular disease and other causes.
We used the China Kadoorie Biobank (CKB) site in Pengzhou, Sichuan, China. We followed a cohort of 55 687 people over 2004-13. We calculated the mean and standard deviation among subgroups classified by fuel use types: gas, coal, wood and electricity (central heating additionally for heating). We tested the mediation effect using the stepwise method and Sobel test. We used Cox proportional models to estimate the risk of incidences of cardiovascular disease and mortality with survival days as the time scale, adjusted for age, gender, socioeconomic status, physical measurements, lifestyle, stove ventilation and fuel type used for other purposes. The survival days were defined as the follow-up days from the baseline survey till the date of death or 31 December 2013 if right-censored. We also calculated the absolute mortality rate difference (ARD) between the exposure group and the reference group.
The study population had an average age of 51.0, and 61.9% of the individuals were female; 64.8% participants (n = 35 543) cooked regularly and 25.4% participants (n = 13 921) needed winter heating. With clean fuel users as the reference group, participant households that used solid fuel for cooking or heating both had a higher risk of all-cause mortality: hazard ratio (HR) for: cooking, 1.11 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02, 1.26]; heating, 1.34 (95% CI 1.16, 1.54). Solid fuel used for winter heating was associated with a higher risk of mortality caused by cerebrovascular disease: HR 1.64 (95% CI 1.12, 2.40); stroke: HR 1.70 (95% CI 1.13, 2.56); and cardiovascular disease: HR 1.49 (95% CI 1.10, 2.02). Low income and poor education level had a significant correlation with solid fuel used for cooking: odds ratio (OR) for income: 2.27 (95% CI 2.14, 2.41); education: 2.34 (95% CI 2.18, 2.53); and for heating: income: 2.69 (95% CI 2.46, 2.97); education: 2.05 (95% CI 1.88, 2.26), which may be potential mediators bridging the effects of socioeconomic status factors on cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. Solid fuel used for cooking and heating accounted for 42.4% and 81.1% of the effect of poor education and 55.2% and 76.0% of the effect of low income on all-cause mortality, respectively. The risk of all-cause mortality could be ameliorated by stopping regularly cooking and heating using solid fuel or switching from solid fuel to clean fuels: HR for cooking: 0.90 (95% CI 0.84, 0.96); heating: 0.76 (95% CI 0.64, 0.92).
Our study reinforces the evidence of an association between solid fuel use and risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. We also assessed the effect of socioeconomic status as the potential mediator on mortality.

This study examined the influence of economic status on mortality in Japanese individuals with AD using a medical claims dataset.
This was a retrospective cohort study.
Medical claims data from April 2014 to March 2019 were obtained from 13 local cities participating in the Longevity Improvement and Fair Evidence study. The inclusion criteria were patients aged 65 years and older who were newly diagnosed with AD during the study period.
The outcome was death during the follow-up period. We assessed economic status by household income (middle to high income and low income); data were obtained from the use of the Medical Expenditure Ceiling Application and Standard Copayment Reduction Card (fee reduction card) when receiving an AD diagnosis, as an indicator of low-income status. We performed multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses to examine the relationship between economic status and mortality; the model was adjusted for age, sex, the Charlson comorbidity index, and antidementia drug use.
We identified 39,081 newly diagnosed patients with AD from the Longevity Improvement and Fair Evidence study database (mean age, 83.6 years; female, 67.1%).

A total of 16.6 million children were orphaned because of deaths associated with HIV/AIDS, of whom 90% live in sub-Saharan Africa. Although most orphaned and separated children and adolescents in this region are cared for by extended family, the large number of children requiring care has produced a proliferation of institutional care. Few studies have investigated the association between care environment and physical health among orphaned and separated youths in sub-Saharan Africa.
To examine the association of care environment with incident HIV and death among orphaned and separated children and adolescents who were living in charitable children's institutions, family-based settings, and street settings in western Kenya over almost 10 years.
The Orphaned and Separated Children's Assessments Related to Their Health and Well-Being (OSCAR) project was an observational prospective cohort study conducted in Uasin Gishu County, Kenya. The cohort comprised 2551 orphaned, separated, and street-connected children from communities within 8 administrative locations, which included 300 randomly selected households (family-based settings) caring for children who were orphaned from all causes, 19 charitable children's institutions (institutional settings), and a convenience sample of 100 children who were practicing self-care on the streets (street settings). Participants were enrolled from May 31, 2010, to April 24, 2013, and were followed up until November 30, 2019.
Care environment (family-based, institutional, or street setting).
Survival regression models were used to investigate the association between care environment and incident HIV, death, and time to incident HIV or death.
Among 2551 participants, 1230 youths were living in family-based settings, 1230 were living in institutional settings, and 91 were living in street settings. Overall, 1321 participants (51.8%) were male, with a mean (SD) age at baseline of 10.4 (4.8) years. Most participants who were living in institutional (1047 of 1230 youths [85.1%]) or street (71 of 91 youths [78.0%]) settings were double orphaned (ie, both parents had died). A total of 59 participants acquired HIV infection or died during the study period. After adjusting for sex, age, and baseline HIV status, living in a charitable children's institution was not associated with death (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 0.26; 95% CI, 0.07-1.02) or incident HIV (AHR, 1.49; 95% CI, 0.46-4.83). Compared with living in a family-based setting, living in a street setting was associated with death (AHR, 5.46; 95% CI, 2.30-12.94), incident HIV (AHR, 17.31; 95% CI, 5.85-51.25), and time to incident HIV or death (AHR, 7.82; 95% CI, 3.48-17.55).
In this study, after adjusting for potential confounders, no association was found between care environment and HIV incidence or death among youths living in institutional vs family-based settings. However, living in a street setting vs a family-based setting was associated with both HIV incidence and death. This study's findings suggest that strengthening of child protection systems and greater investment in evidence-based family support systems that improve child and adolescent health and prevent youth migration to the street are needed for safe and beneficial deinstitutionalization to be implemented at scale.",Adolescent multiple risk behavior is associated with negative outcomes.,Is adolescent multiple risk behavior associated with socioeconomic status in adulthood?,"Prospective cohort studies using British Cohort Study 1970 and ALSPAC, examining the association between adolescent MRB and young adult SES.","Adolescent MRB was negatively associated with young adult SES, with socioeconomic status potentially mediating the effects on cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality.","Need for more detailed measures to capture nuances, potential confounding factors, and implications for targeted interventions."

Cigarette smoking among PLHIV is common (42%), and PLHIV are 6-13 times more likely to die from lung cancer than AIDS-related causes. This study sought to investigate the associations between food security status and smoking status and severity among a cohort of predominantly low-income women of colour living with and without HIV in the USA.
Women enrolled in an ongoing longitudinal cohort study from 2013 to 2015.
Nine participating sites across the USA.
2553 participants enrolled in the Food Insecurity Sub-Study of the Women's Interagency HIV Study, a multisite cohort study of US women living with HIV and demographically similar HIV-seronegative women.
Current cigarette smoking status and intensity were self-reported. We used cross-sectional and longitudinal logistic and Tobit regressions to assess associations of food security status and changes in food security status with smoking status and intensity.
The median age was 48. Most respondents were African-American/black (72%) and living with HIV (71%). Over half had annual incomes ≤US$12 000 (52%). Food insecurity (44%) and cigarette smoking (42%) were prevalent. In analyses adjusting for common sociodemographic characteristics, all categories of food insecurity were associated with greater odds of current smoking compared with food-secure women. Changes in food insecurity were also associated with increased odds of smoking. Any food insecurity was associated with higher smoking intensity.
Food insecurity over time was associated with smoking in this cohort of predominantly low-income women of colour living with or at risk of HIV. Integrating alleviation of food insecurity into smoking cessation programmes may be an effective method to reduce the smoking prevalence and disproportionate lung cancer mortality rate particularly among PLHIV.",People living with HIV have a higher prevalence of food insecurity and lung cancer mortality.,What are the associations between food security status and smoking status and severity among low-income women living with and without HIV in the USA?,"Longitudinal cohort study, assessing the associations between food security status, smoking status, and lung cancer mortality among low-income women.","Food insecurity was associated with increased smoking prevalence and lung cancer mortality, suggesting the need for integrated care to reduce smoking and mortality rates.","Relied on self-reported data, potential recall bias, and need for further investigation on integrated care strategies."

Findings from two UK birth cohort studies,"Tinner L, Wright C, Heron J, Caldwell D, Campbell R, Hickman M.",BMC Public Health. 2021 Sep 3;21(1):1614. doi: 10.1186/s12889-021-11638-3.,Tinner L,BMC Public Health,2021,2021/09/04,PMC8414729,,10.1186/s12889-021-11638-3,"Adolescent multiple risk behaviour (MRB) is associated with negative outcomes such as police arrests, unemployment and premature mortality and morbidity. What is unknown is whether MRB is associated with socioeconomic status (SES) in adulthood. We test whether adolescent MRB is associated with socioeconomic status (SES) in young adulthood and whether it is moderated by early life SES variables.
Prospective cohort studies; British Cohort Study 1970 (BCS70) and Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), born in 1991-1992, were used and two comparable MRB variables were derived. Logistic regression was used to determine the association between MRB and young adult SES. The moderating effect of three early life SES variables was assessed using logistic regression models with and without interaction parameters. Evidence to support the presence of moderation was determined by likelihood ratio tests ≤p = 0.05. Multiple imputation was used to account for missing data.
Adolescents had a median of two risk behaviours in BCS70 and three in ALSPAC. Adolescent MRB was negatively associated with young adult SES (university degree attainment) in BCS70 (OR 0.81, 95% CI: 0.76, 0.86) and ALSPAC (OR 0.85, 95% CI: 0.82, 0.88). There was a dose response relationship, with each additional risk behaviour resulting in reduced odds of university degree attainment. MRB was associated occupational status at age 34 in BCS70 (OR 0.86 95% CI: 0.82, 0.90). In BCS70, there was evidence that maternal education (p = 0.03), parental occupational status (p = 0.009) and household income (p = 0.03) moderated the effect of adolescent MRB on young adult SES in that the negative effect of MRB is stronger for those with low socioeconomic backgrounds. No evidence of moderation was found in the ALSPAC cohort.
Adolescence appears to be a critical time in the life course to address risk behaviours, due to the likelihood that behaviours established here may have effects in adulthood. Intervening on adolescent MRB could improve later SES outcomes and thus affect health outcomes later in life. Evidence for a moderation effect in the BCS70 but not ALSPAC suggests that more detailed measures should be investigated to capture the nuance of contemporary young adult SES.",Adolescent multiple risk behavior is associated with negative outcomes.,How does adolescent multiple risk behavior relate to socioeconomic status in young adulthood?,"Retrospective cohort study using British Cohort Study 1970 and ALSPAC, examining the association between adolescent MRB and young adult SES.","Adolescent MRB was negatively associated with young adult SES, with socioeconomic status potentially mediating the effects on cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality.","Need for more detailed measures to capture nuances, potential confounding factors, and implications for targeted interventions."

Cohort study with follow-up between 12 March 2020 and 23 February 2021.
Swedish register-based study on all residents in Sweden.
3 963 356 Swedish residents in co-residential unions who were 30 years of age or older and alive on 12 March 2020 and living in Sweden in December 2019.
Cox regression models were conducted to assess the association between different constellations of immigrant-native couples (proxy for language proficiency and institutional awareness) and COVID-19 mortality and all other causes of deaths (2019 and 2020). Models were adjusted for relevant confounders.
Compared with Swedish-Swedish couples (1.18 deaths per thousand person-years), both immigrants partnered with another immigrant and a native showed excess mortality for COVID-19 (HR 1.43; 95% CI 1.29 to 1.58 and HR 1.24; 95% CI 1.10 to 1.40, respectively), which translates to 1.37 and 1.28 deaths per thousand person-years. Moreover, similar results are found for natives partnered with an immigrant (HR 1.15; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.29), which translates to 1.29 deaths per thousand person-years. Further analysis shows that immigrants from both high-income and low-income and middle-income countries (LMIC) experience excess mortality also when partnered with a Swede. However, having a Swedish-born partner is only partially protective against COVID-19 mortality among immigrants from LMIC origins.
Language barriers and/or poor institutional awareness are not major drivers for the excess mortality from COVID-19 among immigrants. Rather, our study provides suggestive evidence that excess mortality among immigrants is explained by differential exposure to the virus.",Structural racism leads to adverse health outcomes.,What is the association between ongoing structural racism and mortality in the United States?,Examined the economic mobility gap between White and Black children and its association with Black-White disparities in death rates.,"Economic mobility gap was strongly associated with Black-White disparities in mortality, especially for potentially preventable conditions.","Relied on probability sampling, potential confounding factors, and implications for addressing structural racism."

Whether the recent increases in firearm suicide are explained by state-level household firearm ownership rates and trends remains unknown.
Mortality data from the U.S. National Vital Statistics System and an estimate of state-level household firearm ownership rate were used to conduct hierarchical age-period-cohort (random-effects) modeling of firearm suicide mortality between 2001 and 2016. Models were adjusted for individual-level race and sex and for state-level poverty rate, unemployment rate, median household income in U.S. dollars, population density, and elevation.
Between 2001 and 2016, the crude national firearm suicide mortality rate increased from 6.8 to 8.0 per 100,000, and household firearm ownership rate remained relatively stable, at around 40%. Both variables were markedly heterogeneous and correlated at the state level. Age-period-cohort models revealed period effects (affecting people across ages) and cohort effects (affecting specific birth cohorts) underlying the recent increases in firearm suicide. Individuals born after 2000 had higher firearm suicide rates than most cohorts born before. A 2001-2006 decreasing period effect was followed, after 2009, by an increasing period effect that peaked in 2015. State-level household firearm ownership rates and trends did not explain cohort effects and only minimally explained period effects.
State-level firearm ownership rates largely explain the state-level differences in firearm suicide but only marginally explain recent increases in firearm suicide. Although firearms in the home increase firearm suicide risk, the recent national rise in firearm suicide might be the result of broader, more distal causes of suicide risk.",Low socioeconomic position is associated with a high incidence of diabetic foot ulcers.,What is the association between income and cardiovascular disease in community-dwelling older adults?,"Used the Cardiovascular Health Study cohort, examining the association between income and cardiovascular disease in older Americans.",Low income was independently associated with higher risks of new-onset CVD and death in older adults.,"Relied on retrospective data, potential confounding factors, and need for further risk assessment in DFU outcomes."

Through a literature review and gathered expert perspectives, the Korean Frailty Scale (KFS, 0-6 points) was developed with six questions about weight loss, self-assessment of health status, energy loss, fatigue, social network, and support. The psychometric property was then validated in community-dwelling older adults using the Korean Frailty and Aging Cohort Survey (2016-2019). Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analyses determined optimal cutoff scores for frail, pre-frail, and robust. The predictive validity for mortality, hospitalization, fall events, and disability, such as declines in activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) was assessed after adjusting for age, sex, education level, household income, body-mass index, smoking status, alcohol consumption, physical activity, marital status, current employment, and residence.
The 2,923 participants (mean age: 76.0±3.9 years, female: 52.2%) were categorized into frail (≥3 points, 21.1%), pre-frail (1-2 points, 50.2%) and robust (0 points, 28.7%) groups. Sensitivity (88.3%), specificity (91.6%), and the area under the ROC curve (0.730) for the frail group were sufficient to be accepted as a new frailty scale. The frail group had increased risk of falling (relative risk [RR]: 1.810, 95% confidence interval: 1.354-2.420), mortality (hazard ratio, 6.596, 1.802-24.137), and IADL decline (RR, 1.638, 1.231-2.178).

HIV is also a chronic inflammatory disorder associated with cardiovascular complications, yet the epidemiology of patients affected by both diseases is poorly understood.
Utilizing the Uganda National RHD Registry, we described the echocardiographic findings, clinical characteristics, medication prescription rates, and outcomes of all 73 people carrying concurrent diagnoses of HIV and RHD between 2009 and 2018. These individuals were compared to an age- and sex-matched cohort of 365 subjects with RHD only.
The median age of the HIV-RHD group was 36 years (interquartile range [IQR] 15), and 86% were women. The HIV-RHD cohort had higher rates of prior stroke/transient ischemic attack (12% vs 5%, P = .02) than the RHD-only group, with this association persisting following multivariable adjustment (odds ratio [OR] 3.08, P = .03). Prevalence of other comorbidities, echocardiographic findings, prophylactic penicillin prescription rates, retention in clinical care, and mortality were similar between the 2 groups.
Patients living with RHD and HIV in Uganda are a relatively young, predominantly female group. Although RHD-HIV comorbid individuals have higher rates of stroke, their similar all-cause mortality and RHD care quality metrics (such as retention in care) compared to those with RHD alone suggest rheumatic heart disease defines their clinical outcome more than HIV does.

Sex-, race/ethnicity-, and county-specific data were used to examine sex-specific associations between economic mobility and mortality gaps for all causes combined, heart diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), injury/violence, all malignant cancers, and 14 cancer types. Economic mobility data for 1978-1983 birth cohorts and death rates during 2011-2018 were obtained from the Opportunity Atlas and National Center for Health Statistics, respectively. Data from 471 counties were included in analyses of all-cause mortality at ages 30-39 years during 2011-2018 (corresponding to partially overlapping 1978-1983 birth cohorts); and from 1,572 and 1,248 counties in analyses of all-cause and cause-specific mortality in all ages combined, respectively.
In ages 30-39 years, a one percentile increase in the economic mobility gap was associated with a 6.8 % (95 % confidence interval 1.8 %-11.8 %) increase in the Black-White mortality gap among males and a 13.5 % (8.9 %-18.1 %) increase among females, based on data from 471 counties. In all ages combined, the corresponding percentages based on data from 1,572 counties were 10.2 % (7.2 %-13.2 %) among males and 14.8 % (11.4 %-18.2 %) among females, equivalent to an increase of 18.4 and 14.0 deaths per 100,000 in the mortality gap, respectively.

Compared with the higher income group, hazard ratio (HR) for time to the first occurrence of incident CVD in the lower income group was 1.16 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.03 to 1.31. A lower income was also associated with a significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.08-1.30), and consequently a higher risk of the combined endpoint of incident CVD or death (HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.09-1.31).
Among community-dwelling older Americans free of baseline CVD, an annual household income <$16,000 is independently associated with significantly higher risks of new-onset CVD and death.",,,,,

However, reports on the association between SEP and DFU outcomes are limited. Therefore, in this study, we investigated this association and determined the prognostic factors of DFU outcomes.
The total cohort comprised 976,252 individuals. Using probability sampling, we randomly selected a sample of patients by reviewing the data from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service database of South Korea during 2011-2015. Residence, household income, and insurance type represented SEP. The primary outcome was amputation, and the secondary outcome was mortality. A multivariate model was applied to identify the predictive factors. Amputation-free survival and overall survival were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.
Among 976,252 individuals in the cohort, 1362 had DFUs (mean age 62.9 ± 12.2 years; 42.9% were women). Overall amputation and mortality rates were 4.7 and 12.3%, respectively. Male sex (hazard ratio [HR], 2.41; p < 0.01), low SEP (HR 5.13, 5.13; p = 0.018), ophthalmopathy (HR, 1.89; p = 0.028), circulatory complications (HR, 2.14; p = 0.020), and institutional type (HR, 1.78; p = 0.044) were prognostic factors for amputation. Old age (HR, 1.06; p < 0.01), low SEP (HR, 2.65; p < 0.01), ophthalmopathy (HR, 1.74; p < 0.01), circulatory complications (HR, 1.71; p < 0.01), and institution type (HR 1.84; p < 0.01) were predictors of mortality.
DFU patients with a low SEP are strongly associated with increased amputation and mortality rates.

Maternal psychosocial risk factors included trauma/stressor exposure; posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); depression; psychological distress; and alcohol/tobacco use. Child gestational EA at birth was calculated using an epigenetic clock previously devised for neonates; and gestational EA deviation was calculated as the residuals of the linear model between EA and chronological gestational age. Bivariate linear regression was then used to explore unadjusted associations between maternal/child risk factors and child gestational EA residuals at birth. Thereafter, a multivariable regression method was used to determine adjusted associations. Data from 271 maternal-child dyads were included in the current analysis.

To describe the local spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Valencia, Spain.
This single-center epidemiological cohort study of patients with SARS-CoV-2 was performed at University General Hospital in Valencia (population in the hospital catchment area, 364 000), a tertiary hospital. The study included all consecutive patients with COVID-19 isolated at home from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic on February 19 until August 31, 2020.
Cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by the presence of IgM antibodies or a positive polymerase chain reaction test result on a nasopharyngeal swab were included. Cases in which patients with negative laboratory results met diagnostic and clinical criteria were also included.
The primary outcome was the characterization of dissemination patterns and connections among the 20 neighborhoods of Valencia during the outbreak. To recreate the transmission network, the inbound and outbound connections were studied for each region, and the relative risk of infection was estimated.
In total, 2646 patients were included in the analysis. The mean (SD) age was 45.3 (22.5) years; 1203 (46%) were male and 1442 (54%) were female (data were missing for 1); and the overall mortality was 3.7%. The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 cases was higher in neighborhoods with higher household income (β2 [for mean income per household] = 0.197; 95% CI, 0.057-0.351) and greater population density (β1 [inhabitants per km2] = 0.228; 95% CI, 0.085-0.387). Correlations with meteorological variables were not statistically significant. Neighborhood 3, where the hospital and testing facility were located, had the most outbound connections (14). A large residential complex close to the city (neighborhood 20) had the fewest connections (0 outbound and 2 inbound). Five geographically unconnected neighborhoods were of strategic importance in disrupting the transmission network.
This study of local dissemination of SARS-COV-2 revealed nonevident transmission patterns between geographically unconnected areas. The results suggest that tailor-made containment measures could reduce transmission and that hospitals, including testing facilities, play a crucial role in disease transmission. Consequently, the local dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 spread might inform the strategic lockdown of specific neighborhoods to stop the contagion and avoid a citywide lockdown.",Limited information on SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics at city scale.,"How does SARS-CoV-2 spread locally in Valencia, Spain?","Epidemiological cohort study at University General Hospital in Valencia, estimation of relative risk of infection.",Higher incidence in neighborhoods with higher household income and greater population density.,"Data from single center, potential biases in transmission network estimation."

Return to work (RTW) is an important issue for these patients. In this study, we explored the factors that influence RTW and investigated the influence of RTW on survival outcomes of patients with colorectal cancer.
Data of individuals (N = 4408) in active employment who were diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 2004 and 2010 were derived from 2 nationwide databases. Subjects were categorized into 2 groups according to their employment status at 5-year follow-up. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the factors associated with RTW.

Use of home noninvasive ventilation (NIV) has been linked to improved outcomes including reduced mortality. Despite the importance of NIV, factors promoting optimal NIV usage and determinants of nonadherence have not been rigorously examined. Moreover, given that respiratory issues in DMD span between childhood and adulthood, examination across a broad age group is needed. The objectives of this study were to (1) evaluate NIV usage across a broad spectrum of patients with DMD, including both children and adults, and (2) identify biological and socioeconomic determinants of NIV usage and NIV nonadherence.
We performed a retrospective review of all patients with DMD from February 2016 to February 2020 who underwent evaluation at associated pediatric and adult neuromuscular disease clinics. NIV use was determined objectively from device downloads. A priori, we defined nonadherence as < 4 hours use per night, quantified as the percentage of nights below this threshold across a 30-day period within 6 months of a clinic visit. We also assessed the average hours of NIV usage over this time period. Predictors examined included demographics, social determinants, and pulmonary function.
33 patients with DMD were identified, 29 (87%) of whom were using NIV (13 age < 21 years). Mean age was 22.9 ± 6.6 years (range 13-39 years), body mass index was 23.4 ± 10.4 kg/m
In this cohort of adult and pediatric patients with DMD, most individuals were using NIV. While usage hours were higher with lower lung function, substantial variability remains unexplained by examined factors. Nonadherence was observed in some individuals, including those with advanced disease. Further investigations should focus on evaluating patient-oriented outcomes to define optimal NIV usage across the spectrum of disease and determine strategies to counteract issues with nonadherence.

With linear generalized estimating equations clustered on survivor location, we evaluated associations of household income with differences in FACT-C mean score, overall and stratified by nSES. We used separate models to explore relationships for wellbeing subscales.
We found lower household income to be associated with clinically meaningful differences in overall FACT-C scores [<$30K: -13.6; 95% confidence interval (CI): -16.8 to -10.4] and subscale wellbeing after a recent colorectal cancer diagnosis. Relationships were slightly greater in magnitude for survivors living in lower SES neighborhoods.
Our findings suggest that recently diagnosed lower income colorectal cancer survivors are likely to report lower HRQoL, and modestly more so in lower SES neighborhoods.
The findings from this work will aid future investigators' ability to further consider the contexts in which the income of survivors can be leveraged as a means of improving HRQoL.",Household income predicts health-related quality of life in colorectal cancer survivors.,How does household income impact HRQoL in colorectal cancer survivors?,"Population-based cohort study using PSCCC data, multidimensional nSES index measure.",Lower household income associated with lower HRQoL in colorectal cancer survivors.,"Data limited to specific cohort, potential unmeasured variables."

Our aim was to quantify ethnic differences in SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 outcomes during the first and second waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in England.
We conducted an observational cohort study of adults (aged ≥18 years) registered with primary care practices in England for whom electronic health records were available through the OpenSAFELY platform, and who had at least 1 year of continuous registration at the start of each study period (Feb 1 to Aug 3, 2020 [wave 1], and Sept 1 to Dec 31, 2020 [wave 2]). Individual-level primary care data were linked to data from other sources on the outcomes of interest: SARS-CoV-2 testing and positive test results and COVID-19-related hospital admissions, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, and death. The exposure was self-reported ethnicity as captured on the primary care record, grouped into five high-level census categories (White, South Asian, Black, other, and mixed) and 16 subcategories across these five categories, as well as an unknown ethnicity category. We used multivariable Cox regression to examine ethnic differences in the outcomes of interest. Models were adjusted for age, sex, deprivation, clinical factors and comorbidities, and household size, with stratification by geographical region.
Of 17 288 532 adults included in the study (excluding care home residents), 10 877 978 (62·9%) were White, 1 025 319 (5·9%) were South Asian, 340 912 (2·0%) were Black, 170 484 (1·0%) were of mixed ethnicity, 320 788 (1·9%) were of other ethnicity, and 4 553 051 (26·3%) were of unknown ethnicity. In wave 1, the likelihood of being tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection was slightly higher in the South Asian group (adjusted hazard ratio 1·08 [95% CI 1·07-1·09]), Black group (1·08 [1·06-1·09]), and mixed ethnicity group (1·04 [1·02-1·05]) and was decreased in the other ethnicity group (0·77 [0·76-0·78]) relative to the White group. The risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection was higher in the South Asian group (1·99 [1·94-2·04]), Black group (1·69 [1·62-1·77]), mixed ethnicity group (1·49 [1·39-1·59]), and other ethnicity group (1·20 [1·14-1·28]). Compared with the White group, the four remaining high-level ethnic groups had an increased risk of COVID-19-related hospitalisation (South Asian group 1·48 [1·41-1·55], Black group 1·78 [1·67-1·90], mixed ethnicity group 1·63 [1·45-1·83], other ethnicity group 1·54 [1·41-1·69]), COVID-19-related ICU admission (2·18 [1·92-2·48], 3·12 [2·65-3·67], 2·96 [2·26-3·87], 3·18 [2·58-3·93]), and death (1·26 [1·15-1·37], 1·51 [1·31-1·71], 1·41 [1·11-1·81], 1·22 [1·00-1·48]). In wave 2, the risks of hospitalisation, ICU admission, and death relative to the White group were increased in the South Asian group but attenuated for the Black group compared with these risks in wave 1. Disaggregation into 16 ethnicity groups showed important heterogeneity within the five broader categories.
Some minority ethnic populations in England have excess risks of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and of adverse COVID-19 outcomes compared with the White population, even after accounting for differences in sociodemographic, clinical, and household characteristics. Causes are likely to be multifactorial, and delineating the exact mechanisms is crucial. Tackling ethnic inequalities will require action across many fronts, including reducing structural inequalities, addressing barriers to equitable care, and improving uptake of testing and vaccination.

We examine the trends in characteristics and outcomes of children living with HIV who were younger than 5 years at ART initiation, and compare outcomes over time and across country income groups.
We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of data from children living with HIV who were younger than 5 years at ART initiation from 45 paediatric sites in 16 low-income, lower-middle-income, and upper-middle-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa (Benin, Burundi, Côte d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Rwanda, South Africa, Togo, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe). Outcomes were trends in patient characteristics at ART initiation (age, weight, height, and CD4%), and comparisons of mortality and loss to follow-up during ART over time and in various economic settings. We identified risk factors for mortality using Cox proportional hazards models. Each participating region had relevant institutional ethics review board approvals to contribute data to the analysis.
We included 32 221 children living with HIV and initiating ART younger than 5 years between Jan 1, 2006, and Dec 31, 2017. Median age at ART initiation was 20·4 months (IQR 9·4-36·0) in 2006-10, 19·2 months (8·3-33·6) in 2011-13, and 19·2 months (8·8-33·7) in 2014-17. Median age at ART initiation was 13·2 months (IQR 4·7-26·8) in upper-middle-income countries, 22·6 months (13·2-37·5) in lower-middle-income countries and 24·2 months (13·5-39·1) in low-income countries. The proportion of children initiating ART younger than 3 months increased from 770 (5·1%) of 14 943 children in 2006-10 to 728 (10·0%) of 7290 children in 2014-17. The proportion of children initiating ART with severe immunosuppression decreased from 5469 (74·7%) of 7314 children for whom CD4% data were available in 2006-10 to 2353 (55·2%) of 4269 children in 2014-17. Mortality at 24 months on ART decreased from 970 (6·5%) of 14 943 children in 2006-10 to 214 (2·9%) of 7290 children in 2014-17. Loss to follow-up was 20·5% (95% CI 20·1-21·0) overall, and was similar across time periods. In multivariable analysis, lower mortality was observed for more recent ART initiation cohorts (adjusted hazard ratio 0·70, 95% CI 0·63-0·79 for 2011-13; 0·53, 0·45-0·72 for 2014-17 vs 2006-10) and for those residing in an upper-middle-income country (0·42, 0·35-0·49 vs low-income countries).
Mortality declined significantly after universal ART recommendations for children younger than 2 years in 2010 and children younger than 5 years in 2013. However, substantial variations persisted across country income groups, and one in five children continue to be lost to follow-up. Targeted interventions are required to improve outcomes of children living with HIV, especially in the poorest countries.

Data were drawn from the nationally representative Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey. Two cohorts (baseline age 50+ years) were followed up for 7 years, from 2001 to 2007 and from 2011 to 2017, respectively. Social disadvantage was indicated by the Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA). Two DFLEs based on a Global Activity Limitation Indicator (GALI) and difficulties with activities of daily living (ADLs) measured by the 36-Item Short Form Survey physical function subscale were estimated by cohort, sex and SEIFA tertile using multistate models.
Persons residing in the low-advantage tertile had more years lived with GALI and ADL disability than those in high-advantage tertiles. Across the two cohorts, dynamic equilibrium for GALI disability was observed among men in mid-advantage and high-advantage tertiles, but expansion of GALI disability occurred in the low-advantage tertile. There was expansion of GALI disability for all women irrespective of their SEIFA tertile. Compression of ADL disability was observed for all men and for women in the high-advantage tertile. Compared to the 2001 cohort, disability incidence was lower for the 2011 cohort of men within mid-advantage and high-advantage tertiles, whereas recovery and disability-related mortality were lower for the 2011 cohort of women within the mid-advantage tertile.
Overall, compression of morbidity was more common in high-advantage areas, whereas expansion of morbidity was characteristic of low-advantage areas. Trends also varied by sex and disability severity.",,,,,

The aim of this study was to assess long-term mortality, neurodevelopmental impairments (NDIs), and economic outcomes after infant invasive GBS (iGBS) disease up to adolescence in Denmark and the Netherlands.
For this cohort study, children with iGBS disease were identified in Denmark and the Netherlands using national medical and administrative databases and culture results that confirmed their diagnoses. Exposed children were defined as having a history of iGBS disease (sepsis, meningitis, or pneumonia) by the age of 89 days. For each exposed child, ten unexposed children were randomly selected and matched by sex, year and month of birth, and gestational age. Mortality data were analysed with the use of Cox proportional hazards models. NDI data up to adolescence were captured from discharge diagnoses in the National Patient Registry (Denmark) and special educational support records (the Netherlands). Health care use and household income were also compared between the exposed and unexposed cohorts.
2258 children-1561 in Denmark (born from Jan 1, 1997 to Dec 31, 2017) and 697 in the Netherlands (born from Jan 1, 2000 to Dec 31, 2017)-were identified to have iGBS disease and followed up for a median of 14 years (IQR 7-18) in Denmark and 9 years (6-11) in the Netherlands. 366 children had meningitis, 1763 had sepsis, and 129 had pneumonia (in Denmark only). These children were matched with 22 462 children with no history of iGBS disease. iGBS meningitis was associated with an increased mortality at age 5 years (adjusted hazard ratio 4·08 [95% CI 1·78-9·35] for Denmark and 6·73 [3·76-12·06] for the Netherlands). Any iGBS disease was associated with an increased risk of NDI at 10 years of age, both in Denmark (risk ratio 1·77 [95% CI 1·44-2·18]) and the Netherlands (2·28 [1·64-3·17]). A history of iGBS disease was associated with more frequent outpatient clinic visits (incidence rate ratio 1·93 [95% CI 1·79-2·09], p<0·0001) and hospital admissions (1·33 [1·27-1·38], p<0·0001) in children 5 years or younger. No differences in household income were observed between the exposed and unexposed cohorts.
iGBS disease, especially meningitis, was associated with increased mortality and a higher risk of NDIs in later childhood. This previously unquantified burden underlines the case for a maternal GBS vaccine, and the need to track and provide care for affected survivors of iGBS disease.

However, the contribution of modifiable risk factors to these inequities is not known. This study aimed to quantify the mediating effects of modifiable risk factors to associations between SEP and cancer morbidity and mortality.
This study used a prospective observational cohort design. We combined eight cycles of the Canadian Community Health Survey (2000/2001-2011) as baseline data to identify a cohort of adults (≥35 years) without cancer at the time of survey administration (n = 309 800). The cohort was linked to the Discharge Abstract Database and the Canadian Mortality Database for cancer morbidity and mortality ascertainment. Individuals were followed from the date they completed the Canadian Community Health Survey until 31 March 2013. Dates of individual first hospitalizations for cancer and deaths due to cancer were captured during this time period. SEP was operationalized using a latent variable combining measures of education and household income. Self-reported modifiable risk factors, including smoking, excess alcohol consumption, low fruit-and-vegetable intake, physical inactivity and obesity, were considered as potential mediators. Generalized structural equation modelling was used to estimate the mediating effects of modifiable risk factors in associations between low SEP and cancer morbidity and mortality in the total population and stratified by sex.
Modifiable risk factors together explained 45.6% of associations between low SEP and overall cancer morbidity and mortality. Smoking was the most important mediator in the total population and for males, accounting for 15.5% and 40.2% of the total effect, respectively. For females, obesity was the most important mediator.
Modifiable risk factors are important mediators of socio-economic inequities in cancer morbidity and mortality. Nevertheless, more than half of the variance in these associations remained unexplained. Midstream interventions that target modifiable risk factors may help to alleviate inequities in cancer risk in the short term. However, ultimately, upstream interventions that target structural determinants of health are needed to reduce overall socio-economic inequities in cancer morbidity and mortality.",,,,,

A retrospective cohort study was conducted using the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample 2016 and 2017 data sets. Eligible records included men and women, 15-49 years of age, with an opioid overdose-related ED visit; records for women were stratified by pregnancy status (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision O codes). A multivariable logistic regression model was used to assess the primary outcome of naloxone administration (Current Procedural Terminology code: J2310). Secondary outcomes included subsequent admission and mortality. A subgroup analysis compared pregnant women who did receive naloxone compared with those who did not receive naloxone.
Records from 443,714 men, 304,364 nonpregnant women, and 25,056 pregnant women were included. Nonpregnant women had lower odds for naloxone administration (1.70% vs 2.10%; adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.86 [95% CI 0.83-0.89]) and mortality (2.21% vs 2.99%; aOR 0.71 [95% CI 0.69-0.73]) but higher odds of subsequent admission (30.22% vs 27.18%; aOR 1.04 [95% CI 1.03-1.06]) compared with men. Pregnant women had lower odds for naloxone administration (0.27% vs 1.70%; aOR 0.16 [95% CI 0.13-0.21]) and mortality (0.41% vs 2.21%; aOR 0.28 [95% CI 0.23-0.35]) but higher odds of subsequent admission (40.50% vs 30.22%; aOR 2.04 [95% CI 2.00-2.10]) compared with nonpregnant women.

Pregnant women who did not receive naloxone were more likely to have Medicaid as their expected insurance payer, be in the lowest quartile of median household income for residence ZIP codes, and have a concurrent mental health diagnosis compared with pregnant women who did receive naloxone.
Reproductive-aged women who are nonpregnant and pregnant were less likely to receive naloxone during opioid overdose-related ED visits compared with reproductive-aged men.

In this study, we examined the records of 122,458 patients from the National Cancer Database (NCDB) to determine the significance of socioeconomic factors such as estimated annual household income and education level, which were based on the patient's ZIP Code and the United States Census Bureau's 5-year report from 2008 to 2012. These socioeconomic factors, in addition to marital status, were then assessed individually and as a cumulative socioeconomic score for prognostic significance in a cohort of 2543 patients treated at a tertiary care center utilizing known biologic risk factors, such as cytogenetic risk, International Staging System classification, and serum lactate dehydrogenase levels.
Only marital status and estimated annual household income at diagnosis negatively impacted OS in a univariate analysis, but not in the context of a multivariable analysis incorporating known biologic risk factors.

Given conflicting data and a lack of current epidemiological evidence, we aimed to investigate the association of cannabis use on relevant clinical outcomes among hospitalized patients with gastroparesis.
Patients with a diagnosis of gastroparesis were reviewed from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database between 2008 and 2014. Gastroparesis was identified by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes with patients classified based on a diagnosis of cannabis use disorder. Demographics, comorbidities, socioeconomic status, and outcomes were compared between cohorts using χ2 and analysis of variance. Logistic regression was then performed and annual trends also evaluated.
A total of 1,473,363 patients with gastroparesis were analyzed [n=33,085 (2.25%) of patients with concomitant cannabis use disorder]. Patients with gastroparesis and cannabis use disorder were more likely to be younger and male gender compared with nonusers (36.7±18.8 vs. 51.9±16.8; P<0.001 and 52.9% vs. 33.5%; P<0.001, respectively).

Our objective was to identify differences in inflammation and inflammatory responses between children with moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) and healthy controls (HCs), and search for environmental, pathophysiological, and metabolic factors that may influence this response. Sixteen children with MAM and 16 HCs aged 18-36 months were studied in Nairobi, Kenya. None of the children had symptoms of an infectious disease (fever, diarrhea, or cough) in the 2 weeks before enrollment and sample collection. Demographic and health data were provided by their primary caregivers. Blood samples were collected to measure various biomarkers and the response to an inflammatory stimulus. Children with MAM were more frequently from households with contaminated water, crowding, and unstable income sources. They also had increases in basal inflammation, circulating bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), markers of intestinal damage, and an exaggerated whole blood inflammatory response to LPS. Metabolic changes in children with MAM led to increased plasma levels of long-chain fatty acids, which were found to contribute to the pro-inflammatory state. These exploratory findings suggest convergence of multiple factors to promote dysregulated inflammatory responses and prompt several mechanistic hypotheses that can be pursued to better understand the pathogenesis of MAM.",Acute malnutrition increases morbidity and mortality risk in children.,Identify differences in inflammation between children with moderate acute malnutrition and healthy controls.,"Study of children in Nairobi, Kenya measuring biomarkers and inflammatory responses.",Children with malnutrition had increased inflammation and metabolic changes contributing to dysregulated inflammatory responses.,"Small sample size, potential selection bias."

However, the literature is limited on the relationship between insurance status and hospital outcomes in patients hospitalized with the disease of nervous system. Methods This cross-sectional study used the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database to achieve the results. All Major Diagnostic Category (MDC) codes from patients discharged for disease and disorders of nervous system between the years 2005 to 2014 were queried and analyzed for the impact of lack of insurance on patient outcome. Results Among 4,737,999 discharges, 5.6% had no insurance. The hospital mortality rate among uninsured and insured patients was 4.1% and 3.7%, respectively (P<0.001). In the multivariate analysis, hospital mortality of uninsured patients was higher in the elderly (aOR: 4.74[CI:4.52-4.97], P<0.001), those with comorbidities (aOR: 2.23[CI:2.18-2.27], P<0.001), Asians (aOR: 1.16[CI:1.12-1.20].

However, few studies have examined potential pathways that may explain these findings. The aim of this study is to examine whether familial and behavioural factors during adolescence and socioeconomic disadvantages in early adulthood mediate the association between loss of a parent at age 0 to 12 and all-cause mortality by the age of 63.
A cohort study was conducted using data from the Stockholm Birth Cohort Multigenerational Study for 12,615 children born in 1953, with information covering 1953 to 2016. Familial and behavioural factors at age 13 to 19 included psychiatric and alcohol problems in the surviving parent, receipt of social assistance, and delinquent behaviour in the offspring. Socioeconomic disadvantage in early adulthood included educational attainment, occupational social class, and income at age 27 to 37. We used Cox proportional hazard regression models, combined with a multimediator analysis, to separate direct and indirect effects of parental death on all-cause mortality. Among the 12,582 offspring in the study (men 51%; women 49%), about 3% experienced the death of a parent in childhood. During follow-up from the age of 38 to 63, there were 935 deaths among offspring. Parental death was associated with an elevated risk of mortality after adjusting for demographic and household socioeconomic characteristics at birth (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.52 [95% confidence interval: 1.10 to 2.08, p-value = 0.010]). Delinquent behaviour in adolescence and income during early adulthood were the most influential mediators, and the indirect associations through these variables were HR 1.03 (1.00 to 1.06, 0.029) and HR 1.04 (1.01 to 1.07, 0.029), respectively. After accounting for these indirect paths, the direct path was attenuated to HR 1.35 (0.98 to 1.85, 0.066). The limitations of the study include that the associations may be partly due to genetic, social, and behavioural residual confounding, that statistical power was low in some of the subgroup analyses, and that there might be other relevant paths that were not investigated in the present study.
Our findings from this cohort study suggest that childhood parental death is associated with increased mortality and that the association was mediated through a chain of disadvantages over the life course including delinquency in adolescence and lower income during early adulthood. Professionals working with bereaved children should take the higher mortality risk in bereaved offspring into account and consider its lifelong consequences. When planning and providing support to bereaved children, it may be particularly important to be aware of their increased susceptibility to delinquency and socioeconomic vulnerability that eventually lead to higher mortality.",Parental death during childhood is associated with increased mortality risk.,Examine potential pathways mediating the association between parental death and all-cause mortality.,Cohort study using data from the Stockholm Birth Cohort Multigenerational Study.,Delinquent behavior in adolescence and lower income in early adulthood mediated the association between parental death and mortality.,"Potential residual confounding, low statistical power in some subgroup analyses."

The available literature suggests that child, caregiver and health care provider gender all play important roles in post-discharge adherence to medical advice, treatment-seeking and recovery for ill children in LMICs, including those with undernutrition.
A qualitative study was embedded within a larger multi-country multi-disciplinary observational cohort study involving children aged less than 2 years conducted by the Childhood Acute Illness and Nutrition (CHAIN) Network. Primary data were collected from family members of 22 purposively selected cohort children. Family members were interviewed several times in their homes over the 6 months following hospital discharge (total n = 78 visits to homes). These in-depth interviews were complemented by semi-structured individual interviews with 6 community representatives, 11 community health workers and 12 facility-based health workers, and three group discussions with a total of 24 community representatives. Data were analysed using NVivo11 software, using both narrative and thematic approaches.
We identified gender-related influences at health service/system and household/community levels. These influences interplayed to family members' adherence to medical advice and treatment-seeking after hospital discharge, with potentially important implications for children's recovery. Health service/system level influences included: fewer female medical practitioners in healthcare facilities, which influenced mothers' interest and ability to consult them promptly for their child's illnesses; gender-related challenges for community health workers in supporting mothers with counselling and advice; and male caregivers' being largely absent from the paediatric wards where information sessions to support post-discharge care are offered. Gendered household/community level influences included: women's role as primary caretakers for children and available levels of support; male family members having a dominant role in decision-making related to food and treatment-seeking behaviour; and greater reluctance among parents to invest money and time in the treatment of female children, as compared to male children.
A complex web of gender related influences at health systems/services and household/community levels have important implications for young children's recovery post-discharge. Immediate interventions with potential for positive impact include awareness-raising among all stakeholders - including male family members - on how gender influences child health and recovery, and how to reduce adverse consequences of gender-based discrimination. Specific interventions could include communication interventions in facilities and homes, and changes in routine practices such as who is present in facility interactions. To maximise and sustain the impact of immediate actions and interventions, the structural drivers of women's position in society and gender inequity must also be tackled. This requires interventions to ensure equal equitable opportunities for men and women in all aspects of life, including access to education and income generation activities.

We assessed for the contribution of race and socioeconomic status on cardiotoxicity among women with HER2-positive breast cancer. This retrospective cohort analysis studied women diagnosed with stage I-III HER2-positive breast cancer from 2004-2013. All underwent left ventricular ejection fraction assessment at baseline and at least one follow-up after beginning trastuzumab. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the association between race and socioeconomic status (SES) on cardiotoxicity, defined by clinical heart failure (New York Heart Association class III or IV) or asymptomatic left ventricular ejection fraction decline (absolute decrease ≥ 10% to < 53%, or ≥ 16%). Blacks had the highest prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, and increased BMI. Neighborhood-level SES measures including household income and educational attainment were lower for blacks compared with whites and others. The unadjusted cardiotoxicity risk was significantly higher in black compared with white women (OR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.42 to 3.10). In a multivariable analysis, this disparity persisted after controlling for relevant cardiovascular risk factors (adjusted OR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.25 to 2.84). Additional models adjusting for SES factors of income, educational attainment, and insurance status did not significantly alter the association between race and cardiotoxicity.

We examined whether demographic and socioeconomic factors influenced receipt of adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) in patients with high-risk, early-stage endometrial cancer.
A retrospective study cohort was selected from 349,404 endometrial carcinoma patients from the National Cancer Database in whom adjuvant RT would be recommended per national guidelines. The study included surgically treated patients with endometrioid endometrial cancer with one of the following criteria: 1) FIGO 2009 stage IB, grade 1/2 disease, age ≥ 60 years; 2) stage IB, grade 3 disease; or 3) stage II disease. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with omission of adjuvant RT. Association between adjuvant RT, covariables, and overall survival (OS) was assessed with multivariable Cox proportional hazards models.
19,594 patients were eligible for analysis; 47% did not receive adjuvant RT. Omission of adjuvant RT was more prevalent among African-American, Hispanic, and Asian compared to non-Hispanic white patients (OR 0.79, 95%CI: 0.69-0.91; OR 0.75, 95%CI: 0.64-0.87; OR 0.75, 95%CI: 0.60-0.94, respectively). Lower median household income of patient's area of residence, lack of health insurance, treatment at non-academic hospitals, farther distance to treatment facilities, and residence in metropolitan counties were associated with omission of adjuvant RT.

Although considered high-impact, CNVs are also observed in the general population. This presents a diagnostic challenge in evaluating their clinical significance. To estimate the phenotypic differences between CNV carriers and non-carriers regarding general health and well-being, we compared the impact of SNPD-associated CNVs on health, cognition, and socioeconomic phenotypes to the impact of three genome-wide polygenic risk score (PRS) in two Finnish cohorts (FINRISK, n = 23,053 and NFBC1966, n = 4895). The focus was on CNV carriers and PRS extremes who do not have an SNPD diagnosis. We identified high-risk CNVs (DECIPHER CNVs, risk gene deletions, or large [>1 Mb] CNVs) in 744 study participants (2.66%), 36 (4.8%) of whom had a diagnosed SNPD. In the remaining 708 unaffected carriers, we observed lower educational attainment (EA; OR = 0.77 [95% CI 0.66-0.89]) and lower household income (OR = 0.77 [0.66-0.89]). Income-associated CNVs also lowered household income (OR = 0.50 [0.38-0.66]), and CNVs with medical consequences lowered subjective health (OR = 0.48 [0.32-0.72]). The impact of PRSs was broader. At the lowest extreme of PRS for EA, we observed lower EA (OR = 0.31 [0.26-0.37]), lower-income (OR = 0.66 [0.57-0.77]), lower subjective health (OR = 0.72 [0.61-0.83]), and increased mortality (Cox's HR = 1.55 [1.21-1.98]). PRS for intelligence had a similar impact, whereas PRS for schizophrenia did not affect these traits. We conclude that the majority of working-age individuals carrying high-risk CNVs without SNPD diagnosis have a modest impact on morbidity and mortality, as well as the limited impact on income and educational attainment, compared to individuals at the extreme end of common genetic variation. Our findings highlight that the contribution of traditional high-risk variants such as CNVs should be analyzed in a broader genetic context, rather than evaluated in isolation.",Copy number variants (CNVs) are associated with severe neurological and psychiatric disorders.,Compare the impact of SNPD-associated CNVs and polygenic risk scores on health and socioeconomic phenotypes.,Cross-sectional analysis of Finnish cohorts comparing CNV carriers to PRS extremes.,"High-risk CNVs were associated with lower educational attainment and income, while PRS extremes had broader impacts.","Limited to Finnish cohorts, potential confounding factors."

Food-insecure individuals often depend on low-cost, energy-dense but nutritionally poor foods, resulting in obesity and chronic diseases related to NAFLD.
To determine whether food insecurity is associated with NAFLD in a cohort of HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infected and uninfected adults.
We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of low-income, middle-aged adults from the Miami Adult Studies on HIV (MASH) cohort without a history of excessive alcohol consumption. Food security was assessed with the USDA's Household Food Security Survey. MRIs were used to assess liver steatosis and fibrosis. Metabolic parameters were assessed from fasting blood, anthropometrics, and vitals.
Of the total 603 participants, 32.0% reported food insecurity. The prevalences of NAFLD, fibrosis, and advanced fibrosis were 16.1%, 15.1%, and 4.6%, respectively. For every 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI, the odds of NAFLD increased by a factor of 3.83 (95% CI, 2.37-6.19) in food-insecure participants compared to 1.32 (95% CI, 1.04-1.67) in food-secure participants.

HIV and HCV infections were associated with increased risks for fibrosis, but the relationship between food insecurity and liver fibrosis did not differ between infected and uninfected participants.
Among low-income, middle-aged adults, food insecurity exacerbated the risk for NAFLD associated with a higher BMI and independently increased the risk for advanced liver fibrosis.

The aim of this study is to explore the association of these variables with the risk of death by suicide among young adults.
The study population consisted of 15,534,438 individuals aged 20-39 years from the Korean National Health Insurance Service. Sociodemographic factors associated with death by suicide during 2006-2015 were evaluated. 3,396,353 individuals who underwent health examinations between 2002 and 2005 were separately assessed for health behaviors and biological indicators associated with death by suicide. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to determine the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for suicide mortality according to sociodemographic factors (age, household income, job status, residence, and Charlson comorbidity index score), health behaviors (physical activity, smoking, and alcohol consumption), and biological indicators (blood pressure, total cholesterol level, body mass index, and fasting serum glucose level).
Low household income, self- and non-employment, increased comorbidity, smoking, and normal weight elevated the risk of death by suicide among young adults. While older age was associated with elevated risk for death by suicide among men (adjusted HR [aHR] = 2.11; 95% CI, 2.02-2.20 for men aged 35-39 years), older age reduced the risk for death by suicide among women (aHR = 0.72; 95% CI, 0.69-0.75 for women aged 35-39 years).

This study investigated whether socioeconomic status and/or race/ethnicity is associated with mortality among children treated for sepsis in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). A retrospective cohort study was conducted using information from 48 children's hospitals included in the Pediatric Health Information System database. We included visits by children ≤ 21 years with All Patients Refined Diagnosis-Related Groups (APR-DRG) diagnosis codes of septicemia and disseminated infections that resulted in PICU admission from 2010 to 2016. Multivariable logistic regression was used to measure the effect of race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status (insurance status and median household income for zip code) on mortality after adjustment for age, gender, illness severity, and presence of complex chronic condition. Among the 14,276 patients with sepsis, the mortality rate was 6.8%. In multivariable analysis, socioeconomic status, but not race/ethnicity, was associated with mortality. In comparison to privately insured children, nonprivately insured children had increased odds of mortality (public: adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.2 [1.0, 1.5]; uninsured: aOR: 2.1 [1.2, 3.7]). Similarly, children living in zip codes with the lowest quartile of annual household income had higher odds of mortality than those in the highest quartile (aOR: 1.5 [1.0, 2.2]).

Outcomes were investigated using the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results database with data from 13 states between the years 2007-2015. Covariates included age, sex, insurance, marital status, and tumor stage at diagnosis. Patients <18 years old or with missing data for race, survival time or insurance status were excluded. Cox regression models were used to determine associations through hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and to adjust for covariates.
A total of 8421 subjects were included in the analysis. After adjustment, there was no association between race and 5-year cause-specific survival in patients with ccRCC (Black- HR: 0.96, 95%CI: 0.83,1.12; American Indian/Alaskan- HR: 1.01, 95%CI: 0.75,1.36; Asian Pacific Islander- HR: 0.99, 95%CI: 0.82,1.12).

Our study found that race was not associated with 5-year cause-specific survival from clear cell renal cell carcinoma. However inferior overall survival in Blacks with RCC has been well demonstrated in the literature. Our findings suggest that differences in survival may not be driven by cause-specific factors such as renal cell carcinoma, but rather social determinants of health which disproportionality affect Black patients.

Indices reflecting social deprivation have been developed for population management, but are difficult to operationalize during clinical care. We examined whether a simple count of SDH is associated with fatal incident CHD and nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI).
We used data from the prospective longitudinal REGARDS cohort study (Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke), a national population-based sample of community-dwelling Black and White adults age ≥45 years recruited from 2003 to 2007. Seven SDH from the 5 Healthy People 2020 domains included social context (Black race, social isolation); education (educational attainment); economic stability (annual household income); neighborhood (living in a zip code with high poverty); and health care (lacking health insurance, living in 1 of the 9 US states with the least public health infrastructure). Outcomes were expert adjudicated fatal incident CHD and nonfatal MI.
Of 22 152 participants free of CHD at baseline, 58.8% were women and 42.0% were Black; 20.6% had no SDH, 30.6% had 1, 23.0% had 2, and 25.8% had ≥3. There were 463 fatal incident CHD events and 932 nonfatal MIs over a median of 10.7 years (interquartile range, 6.6 to 12.7). Fewer SDHs were associated with nonfatal MI than with fatal incident CHD. The age-adjusted incidence per 1000 person-years increased with the number of SDH for both fatal incident CHD (0 SDH, 1.30; 1 SDH, 1.44; 2 SDH, 2.05; ≥3 SDH, 2.86) and nonfatal MI (0 SDH, 3.91; 1 SDH, 4.33; ≥2 SDH, 5.44).

The study population was a random sample of patients undergoing surgery for stage I to III CRC between years 2006 and 2007 with 5 years of follow-up. Propensity-weighted multivariable Cox regression was performed with pooled results to yield statistical inferences. Prespecified sensitivity analysis was performed only for patients who received guideline concordant care (GCC) of primary CRC. All statistical tests were 2-sided.
The study population included 8176 patients, 9.9% (n = 811) Black and 90.1% (n = 7365) White. Black patients were more likely to be uninsured or underinsured, have lower household income, and lower educational status (all P < .001). Rates of GCC were higher among Black vs White patients with colon cancer (76.9% vs 72.6%, P = .02), and Black and White patients with rectal cancer were treated with radiation at similar rates (69.1% vs 66.6%, P = .64).

We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study using linked health administrative data (Jan. 1, 2010, to Dec. 31, 2016) in Ontario for people aged 16-105 years who made at least 2 emergency department visits for mental or behavioural disorders due to alcohol within 1 year. We subdivided the cohort based on visit frequency (2, 3 or 4, or ≥ 5). The primary outcome was 1-year mortality, adjusted for age, sex, income, rural residence and presence of comorbidities. We examined premature mortality using years of potential life lost (YPLL).
Of the 25 813 people included in the cohort, 17 020 (65.9%) had 2 emergency department visits within 1 year, 5704 (22.1%) had 3 or 4 visits, and 3089 (12.0%) had 5 or more visits. Males, people aged 45-64 years, and those living in urban centres and lower-income neighbourhoods were more likely to have 3 or 4 visits, or 5 or more visits. The all-cause 1-year mortality rate was 5.4% overall, ranging from 4.7% among patients with 2 visits to 8.8% among those with 5 or more visits. Death due to external causes (e.g., suicide, accidents) was most common. The adjusted mortality rate was 38% higher for patients with 5 or more visits than for those with 2 visits (adjusted hazard ratio 1.38, 95% confidence interval 1.19-1.59).

Predicting individual patient risk allows for preventive interventions to address modifiable risk factors and helps managing expectations. Despite a variety of risk prediction tools for perioperative morbidity in older patients, there is no tool available to predict successful recovery of a patient's ability to live independently in this highly vulnerable population.
In this study, we asked: (1) What factors predict adverse discharge disposition in patients older than 60 years after lower-extremity surgery? (2) Can a prediction instrument incorporating these factors be applied to another patient population with reasonable accuracy? (3) How does the instrument compare with other predictions scores that account for frailty, comorbidities, or procedural risk alone?
In this retrospective study at two competing New England university hospitals and Level 1 trauma centers with 673 and 1017 beds, respectively; 83% (19,961 of 24,095) of patients 60 years or older undergoing lower-extremity orthopaedic surgery were included. In all, 5% (1316 of 24,095) patients not living at home and 12% (2797 of 24,095) patients with missing data were excluded. All patients were living at home before surgery. The mean age was 72 ± 9 years, 60% (11,981 of 19,961) patients were female, 21% (4155 of 19,961) underwent fracture care, and 34% (6882 of 19,961) underwent elective joint replacements. Candidate predictors were tested in a multivariable logistic regression model for adverse discharge disposition in a development cohort of all 14,123 patients from the first hospital, and then included in a prediction instrument that was validated in all 5838 patients from the second hospital by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (ROC-AUC).Thirty-eight percent (5360 of 14,262) of patients in the development cohort and 37% (2184 of 5910) of patients in the validation cohort had adverse discharge disposition. Score performance in predicting adverse discharge disposition was then compared with prediction scores considering frailty (modified Frailty Index-5 or mFI-5), comorbidities (Charlson Comorbidity Index or CCI), and procedural risks (Procedural Severity Scores for Morbidity and Mortality or PSS).
After controlling for potential confounders like BMI, cardiac, renal and pulmonary disease, we found that the most prominent factors were age older than 90 years (10 points), hip or knee surgery (7 or 8 points), fracture management (6 points), dementia (5 points), unmarried status (3 points), federally provided insurance (2 points), and low estimated household income based on ZIP code (1 point). Higher score values indicate a higher risk of adverse discharge disposition. The score comprised 19 variables, including socioeconomic characteristics, surgical management, and comorbidities with a cutoff value of ≥ 23 points. Score performance yielded an ROC-AUC of 0.85 (95% confidence interval 0.84 to 0.85) in the development and 0.72 (95% CI 0.71 to 0.73) in the independent validation cohort, indicating excellent and good discriminative ability. Performance of the instrument in predicting adverse discharge in the validation cohort was superior to the mFI-5, CCI, and PSS (ROC-AUC 0.72 versus 0.58, 0.57, and 0.57, respectively).
The Adverse Discharge in Older Patients after Lower Extremity Surgery (ADELES) score predicts adverse discharge disposition after lower-extremity surgery, reflecting loss of the ability to live independently. Its discriminative ability is better than instruments that consider frailty, comorbidities, or procedural risk alone. The ADELES score identifies modifiable risk factors, including general anesthesia and prolonged preoperative hospitalization, and should be used to streamline patient and family expectation management and improve shared decision making. Future studies need to evaluate the score in community hospitals and in institutions with different rates of adverse discharge disposition and lower income.

A total of 1481 participants were randomly identified and recruited in 2014 for the baseline study. We collected data on demographic, socio-economic status, respiratory symptoms and potentially relevant exposures such as smoking, household fuels, environmental exposures, occupational history/exposures, dietary intake, healthcare utilization, cost (medication, outpatient visits and inpatient admissions) and productivity losses. Spirometry was performed to assess lung function. At baseline, 56.9% of the participants were female, mean age was 43.8 (SD:17.8) and mean body mass index (BMI) was 21.6 Kg/m2 (SD: 3.46).
The cohort has reported the prevalence of chronic respiratory symptoms (13.6%, 95% confidence interval [CI], 11.9-15.4), spirometric obstruction (8.7%, 95% CI, 7.0-10.7), and spirometric restriction (34.8%, 95% CI, 31.7-38.0). Additionally, an annual decline in forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV1] of 30.9mL/year (95% CI: 21.6 to 40.1) and forced vital capacity [FVC] by 38.3 mL/year (95% CI: 28.5 to 48.1) has been reported.
The ongoing phases of follow-up will determine the annual rate of decline in lung function as measured through spirometry and the development of airflow obstruction and restriction, and relate these to morbidity, mortality and economic cost of airflow obstruction and restriction. Population-based mathematical models will be developed driven by the empirical data from the cohort and national population data for Malawi to assess the effects of interventions and programmes to address the lung burden in Malawi.

We investigated the effect of time-varying psychosocial work stressors on mortality using data from a longitudinal cohort of working Australians by examining association between job control, job demands, job insecurity, unfair pay overtime and all-cause mortality. We examined whether gender modified these relationships.
Over 20,000 participants from the Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey with self-reported repeated exposure measures were followed for 15 years. Survival analysis models with baseline hazard specified by the Weibull distribution were used to examine the association between psychosocial work stressors over time and mortality.
Low job control (HR=1.39; 95% CI: 1.06-1.83) and job insecurity (1.36; 1.06-1.74) were associated with increased risk of mortality. High job demands (1.01; 0.75-1.34) and effort-reward unfairness (1.20; 0.90-1.59) were not associated with mortality. The effect of job insecurity was attenuated (1.20; 0.93-1.54) after controlling for sociodemographic and health risk factors. Male participants exposed to low job control and job insecurity had an 81% and 39% increase risk of mortality, respectively.
Long-term exposure to low job control and low job security is associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality. Effects were largely restricted to males and persisted after adjustments for sociodemographic and health characteristics. The lack of effects observed for females may have been due to the small number of deaths in females.

This study aims to discuss the association between SES and survival of patients with retinoblastoma (RB) from a tertiary treatment center.
A retrospective cohort study was conducted, including all patients with RB referred to the Brazilian National Institute of Cancer in Rio de Janeiro (January 2000-December 2016).
Data from 160 patients were analyzed with mean age at diagnosis of 22.85 months (SD ± 14.29). Eighty-three patients (51.9%) had an interval to diagnosis equal to or longer than six months, and 13 children (8.1%) abandoned treatment. Five-year overall survival rate for all patients was 78.8% (95% CI, 72.4%-85.9%). In a multivariate model, patients whose fathers had more than nine years of study had a lower death risk. Patients from families having more than one child under five years had a 213% higher risk of death compared with those living with no other small child. Treatment abandonment also had a profound effect on death risk.
Childhood cancer is notably important considering the potential years of life lost. RB has even more important elements, as the possibility of vision loss in cases with delayed diagnosis. Family characteristics seem to be highly related to RB survival, especially in low- and middle-income countries, where inequalities are still a public health issue.

We aimed to investigate general health status in youth with intellectual disabilities with and without Down syndrome over the transitional period and quantify the extent to which personal characteristics, parental relationship and household income are associated with general health status.
The National Longitudinal Transitions Study-2 includes a nationally representative sample of youth receiving special education services aged 13-17 years at wave 1, followed up over 10 years in five waves of data collection. Data on general health status of youth with intellectual disabilities with and without Down syndrome were obtained from parent reports. We summarised overall demographics and general health status and plotted general health status for those who had health data available for all five waves. We then used random-effects ordered logistic regression to investigate whether wave of data collection, age, sex, Down syndrome, ethnicity, parental relationship status and household income are associated with general health status.
At wave 1, data on intellectual disabilities were available on 9008/9576 (94.1%) young people, and 871/9008 (9.7%) of them had intellectual disabilities, of whom 125/871 (14.4%) had Down syndrome. Youth with intellectual disabilities with or without Down syndrome had low rates of excellent or very good health. Across waves 1-5, there was a shallow gradient in the proportion of youth with intellectual disabilities reporting excellent/very good health, from 57.7% at 13-17 years to 52.6% at 21-25 years, being more marked for those without Down syndrome (57.8% at 13-17 years to 51.8% at 21-25 years). However, contrary to our expectations, an ordinal measure of general health status did not decline over this transitional period and did not differ between youth with and without Down syndrome. There was a gradient with higher income associated with better health, significantly so over $50 001 (odds ratio = 0.559, 95% confidence interval 0.366-0.854). Poorer health was experienced by youth with Hispanic, Latino or Spanish ethnicity (odds ratio = 1.790, 95% confidence interval 1.051-3.048). Female sex and parental relationship status were not associated with health status.
Young people with intellectual disabilities have bad health, and require support across all ages, including transition. Schools, teachers and staff in transitional services should consider health, and health care and support during transitional planning due to change in service provision and be aware of ethnicity and the stressful effects of low household income. This is important as interventions based on provision of greater support can prevent adverse consequences.","Youth with intellectual disabilities have poor general health, and personal characteristics, parental relationship, and household income may influence their health status.","How does general health status vary in youth with intellectual disabilities with and without Down syndrome over the transitional period, and what factors are associated with their health status?","Used data from the National Longitudinal Transitions Study-2, summarised demographics and general health status, and conducted random-effects ordered logistic regression.","Youth with intellectual disabilities had low rates of excellent/very good health, and health status did not decline over the transitional period.

All cases included in this study were elective and not associated with additional procedures. Demographic, clinical, and hospital characteristics were extracted. Independent predictors of complications and outcomes were determined by multivariable regression analysis.
Component separation was performed in 4346 patients. Mean age was 56; majority were female (55%) and white (80%). Most patients (73%) underwent surgery in an urban teaching hospital; mesh was used in 80% of cases and 11% were smokers. Hypertension was the most common comorbidity (50%), followed by obesity (26%), diabetes mellitus (DM) (23%), coronary artery disease (11%), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (8%). Half of the patients (50%) had private insurance, and 35% had Medicare. Patients were distributed equally over household income quartiles. The mortality rate was 0.5%; median length of stay was 5 d.

Out of 9,586 admission episodes, 8,263 were included. Modified from the Geriatric Screening for Care-10, six common geriatric health issues, namely, dysphagia, polypharmacy, fecal incontinence, functional mobility, depression, and dementia, were evaluated. Fall, hospital-acquired pressure ulcer (HPU), and mortality were checked daily by experienced nurses during the patients' hospital stay. A logistic regression model was used, and P < 0.05 was the threshold of significance.
The incidence rates of fall and HPU were 1.3 % and 4.0 %, respectively. The hospital mortality was 6.1 %. Older adult patients with dysphagia or dementia upon admission were significantly associated with an increased likelihood of falls. Furthermore, age, ER admission, low income, fecal incontinence, or functional immobility increased the HPU incidence.

Given research associating food insecurity with higher risk of premature mortality, our objective was to determine the likelihood that food-insecure adults with incomes below the national median would live past 65 to collect the public pension.
We linked respondents of the Canadian Community Health Survey 2005-15 to the death records from the Canadian Vital Statistics Database 2005-17. We assessed household food insecurity status through a validated 18-item questionnaire for 50,780 adults aged 52-64 at interview and with household income below the national median. We traced their vital status up to the age of 65. We fitted Cox proportional hazard models to compare hazard of all-cause mortality before 65 by food insecurity status while adjusting for individual demographic attributes, baseline health, and household socioeconomic characteristics. We also stratified the sample by income and analyzed the subsamples with income above and below the Low Income Measure separately.
Marginal, moderate, and severe food insecurity were experienced by 4.1, 7.3, and 4.5% of the sampled adults, respectively. The crude mortality rate was 49 per 10,000 person-years for food-secure adults and 86, 98, and 150 per 10,000 person-years for their marginally, moderately, and severely food-insecure counterparts, respectively. For the full sample and low-income subsample, respectively, severe food insecurity was associated with 1.24 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.45) and 1.28 (95% CI: 1.07, 1.52) times higher hazard of dying before 65 relative to food security. No association was found between food insecurity and mortality in the higher-income subsample.

We examined trends in socioeconomic inequalities in premature and avoidable mortality in Canada.
We conducted a population-based repeated cohort study using the 1991, 1996, 2001, 2006 and 2011 Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohorts. We linked individual-level Census records for adults aged 25-74 years to register-based mortality data. We defined premature mortality as death before age 75 years. For each census cohort, we estimated age-standardized rates, risk differences and risk ratios for premature and avoidable mortality by level of household income and education.
We identified 16 284 045 Census records. Between 1991 and 2016, premature mortality rates declined in all socioeconomic groups except for women without a high school diploma. Absolute income-related inequalities narrowed among men (from 2478 to 1915 deaths per 100 000) and widened among women (from 1008 to 1085 deaths per 100 000). Absolute education-related inequalities widened among men and women. Relative socioeconomic inequalities in premature mortality widened progressively over the study period. For example, the relative risk of premature mortality associated with the lowest income quintile increased from 2.10 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.02-2.17) to 2.79 (95% CI 2.66-2.91) among men and from 1.72 (95% CI 1.63- 1.81) to 2.50 (95% CI 2.36-2.64) among women.

However, the impact of these factors has yet to be fully elucidated in the setting of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
We designed a retrospective cohort study utilizing data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program to identify patients diagnosed with resectable HCC (N = 28,518). Demographic factors of interest included race (Asian/Pacific Islander [API], African American [AA], Native American/Alaska Native [NA], or White [WH]) and gender (male [M] or female [F]). Insurance classifications included those having Medicare/Private Insurance [ME/PI], Medicaid [MAID], or No Insurance [NI]. Median household income was estimated for all diagnosed with HCC. Endpoints included: (1) overall survival; (2) likelihood of receiving a recommendation for surgery; and (3) specific surgical intervention performed. Multivariate multinomial logistic regression for relative risk ratio (RRR) and Cox regression models were used to identify pertinent associations.
Race, gender, insurance status, and income had statistically significant effects on the likelihood of surgical recommendation and overall survival. API were more likely to receive a recommendation for hepatic resection (RRR = 1.45; 95% CI: 1.31-1.61; Reference Race: AA) and exhibited prolonged overall survival (HR = 0.77; 95% CI: 0.73-0.82; Reference Race: AA) as compared to members of any other ethnic group; there was no difference in these endpoints between AA, NA, or WH individuals. Gender also had a significant effect on survival: Females exhibited superior overall survival (HR = 0.89; 95% CI: 0.85-0.93; Reference Gender: M) as compared to males. Patients who had ME/PI were more likely than those with MAID or NI to receive a surgical recommendation. ME/PI was also associated with superior overall survival. Conclusions: Race, gender, insurance status, and income have measurable effects on HCC management and outcomes. The underlying causes of these disparities warrant further investigation.","Race, gender, insurance status, and income are important predictors of health care outcomes, and disparities exist in the management and outcomes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).","How do race, gender, insurance status, and income impact the management and outcomes of resectable HCC?","Retrospective cohort study using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data, analyzed demographic factors and treatment outcomes, and used regression models to identify associations.","Race, gender, insurance status, and income significantly influenced the likelihood of surgical recommendation and overall survival in HCC patients.

It is associated with infant morbidity and mortality. Survivor of preterm suffers long term health consequences such as respiratory, hearing and visual problems as well as delivering preterm infants. Preterm birth also tends to recur in subsequent pregnancies. Little is known about recurrent rate of preterm birth and associated factors in Tanzania. This study aimed to determine the recurrence rate of preterm birth and associated factors among women who delivered at Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre (KCMC), in Northern Tanzania.
A historic cohort study was designed using maternally-linked data from KCMC medical birth registry. Women who delivered 2 or more singletons were included. A total of 5,946 deliveries were analysed. Recurrence of preterm birth and associated risk factors were estimated using multivariable log-binomial regression model with robust standard error to account for repeated births from the same mother.
Overall recurrent rate of preterm birth was 24.4%. The recurrence of early preterm birth was higher compared to late preterm birth (26.2% vs. 24.2%). Similar pattern of recurrence was observed for spontaneous and medically indicated preterm birth (13.5% vs. 10.9%, respectively). Previous preterm birth (RR;1.85, 95% CI: 1.49, 2.31), preeclampsia (RR;1.46, 95% CI: 1.07, 2.00), long inter-pregnancy interval (RR;1.22, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.49) and clinical subtypes (RR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.86) were important predictors for recurrent preterm birth.
Recurrence of preterm birth remains higher in this population. The rate of preterm recurrence was dependent of gestational age and sub-clinical subtype.

We used retrospective cohort population-based study data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program on 547,703 women aged ≥ 20 years diagnosed with breast cancer primary tumors from 2007 to 2016. Statistical analysis used logistic regression to assess predictors of early-stage breast cancer and Cox proportional hazards regression for mortality risks.
African American women were more likely to be diagnosed at advanced-stage, had larger tumor size at diagnosis, and received less cancer-directed surgery, but more chemotherapy than Caucasian women.

A prospective observational cohort of patients enrolled between June 18, 2010, and August 8, 2013. Baseline interviews were conducted before surgery, and delirium/delirium severity was evaluated daily during hospitalization. Research staff evaluating delirium were blinded to baseline cognitive status.
Two academic medical centers in Boston, MA.
A total of 560 older adults, aged 70 years or older, undergoing major noncardiac surgery.
The Area Deprivation Index (ADI) was used to characterize each neighborhood's socioeconomic disadvantage.
Delirium was assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) long form. Delirium severity was calculated using the highest value of CAM Severity score (CAM-S) occurring during daily hospital assessments (CAM-S Peak).
Residing in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods (ADI > 44) was associated with a higher risk of incident delirium (12/26; 46%), compared with the least disadvantaged neighborhoods (122/534; 23%) (risk ratio (RR) (95% confidence interval (CI)) = 2.0 (1.3-3.1). The CAM-S Peak score was significantly associated with ADI (Spearman rank correlation, ρ = 0.11; P = .009). Mean CAM-S Peak scores generally rose from 3.7 to 5.3 across levels of increasing neighborhood disadvantage. The RR (95% CI) values associated with individual-level markers of socioeconomic status and cultural background were: 1.2 (0.9-1.7) for education of 12 years or less; 1.3 (0.8-2.1) for non-White race; and 1.7 (1.1-2.6) for annual household income of less than $20,000. None of these individual-level markers exceeded the ADI in terms of effect size or significance for prediction of delirium risk.

A total of 3791 patients with clear cell mRCC diagnosed between 2010 and 2015 were enrolled in cohort one. There was an obvious imbalance of race and insurance status in patients with difference MHI. Compared with patients in the poorest quartile 1 (Q1), those in the wealthiest Q4 had a 4-month prolonged OS (P < 0.01) and a 5-month prolonged CSS (P < 0.01), and those in Q3 and Q4 had significantly lower death risk. High income decreased cumulative cancer-specific mortality rates, and potentially favored survival in most subgroups. 6619 patients diagnosed between 2004 and 2015 were included in cohort two. We found that only those with Q4 income achieved a prolonged survival with statistical significance by comparing between patients diagnosed in 2004-2009 and 2010-2015.

Logistic regression of all Q1 versus Q4 patients (n = 970) demonstrated increased survival for the highest income patients (Q4) (mortality 30-day P = 0.220, 90-day P = 0.028, all follow-up P = 0.027). Analysis of exact-matched patients (Q1 vs. Q4; n = 462), demonstrated higher income was associated with escalating, nonsignificant, survival rates at 30 (mortality 3.90% Q1 vs. 2.60% Q4, P = 0.424) and 90 days (mortality 13.42% Q1 vs. 8.66 Q4, P = 0.101) but significantly increased survival during total follow-up (mortality Q1 46.75%, Q4 35.06%, P = 0.010). No significant difference was noted for the remaining studied outcomes.
Patients matched on a multitude of characteristics, of lesser household income, had higher long-term mortality after brain tumor resection. Further understanding of this disparity should be sought and differences mitigated.","Certain inflammatory skin diseases are associated with multiple risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE), and understanding these associations is important for patient care.",Is there an association between inflammatory skin diseases and venous thromboembolism (VTE) in US adults?,"Analyzed data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, assessed the association between inflammatory skin diseases and VTE, and used logistic regression models to determine odds ratios.","Hospitalization for atopic dermatitis, pemphigus, and pemphigoid was associated with VTE, with higher odds of VTE in these patients.

Infants born LBW, including those born preterm (<37 weeks gestation), are at increased risk for numerous consequences, including neonatal mortality and morbidity as well as suboptimal health and nutritional status later in life. The objective of this study was to identify predictors of LBW and preterm birth among infants in rural Uganda.
Data were derived from a prospective birth cohort study conducted from 2014-2016 in 12 districts across northern and southwestern Uganda. Birth weights were measured in triplicate to the nearest 0.1 kg by trained enumerators within 72 hours of delivery. Gestational age was calculated from the first day of last menstrual period (LMP). Associations between household, maternal, and infant characteristics and birth outcomes (LBW and preterm birth) were assessed using bivariate and multivariable logistic regression with stepwise, backward selection analyses.
Among infants in the study, 4.3% were born LBW (143/3,337), and 19.4% were born preterm (744/3,841). In multivariable analysis, mothers who were taller (>150 cm) (adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) = 0.42 (95% CI = 0.24, 0.72)), multigravida (aOR = 0.62 (95% CI = 0.39, 0.97)), or with adequate birth spacing (>24 months) (aOR = 0.60 (95% CI = 0.39, 0.92)) had lower odds of delivering a LBW infant Mothers with severe household food insecurity (aOR = 1.84 (95% CI = 1.22, 2.79)) or who tested positive for malaria during pregnancy (aOR = 2.06 (95% CI = 1.10, 3.85)) had higher odds of delivering a LBW infant. In addition, in multivariable analysis, mothers who resided in the Southwest (aOR = 0.64 (95% CI = 0.54, 0.76)), were ≥20 years old (aOR = 0.76 (95% CI = 0.61, 0.94)), with adequate birth spacing (aOR = 0.76 (95% CI = 0.63, 0.93)), or attended ≥4 antenatal care (ANC) visits (aOR = 0.56 (95% CI = 0.47, 0.67)) had lower odds of delivering a preterm infant; mothers who were neither married nor cohabitating (aOR = 1.42 (95% CI = 1.00, 2.00)) or delivered at home (aOR = 1.25 (95% CI = 1.04, 1.51)) had higher odds.
In rural Uganda, severe household food insecurity, adolescent pregnancy, inadequate birth spacing, malaria infection, suboptimal ANC attendance, and home delivery represent modifiable risk factors associated with higher rates of LBW and/or preterm birth. Future studies on interventions to address these risk factors may be warranted.",,,,,

We aimed to evaluate how these factors may affect survival outcomes in an overall and cause-specific manner using large, national cancer registry cohort data in the temozolomide chemoradiation era.
The National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was queried for patients diagnosed with glioblastoma between 2005 and 2016. Overall survival was assessed using Cox proportional hazard models using disease intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Cause-specific mortality was assessed using cumulative incidence curves and modeled using multivariate cumulative risk regression.
A total of 28,952 patients met the prespecified inclusion criteria and were included in this analysis. The following factors were associated with all-cause mortality: age, calendar year of diagnosis, sex, treatment receipt, tumor size, tumor location, extent of resection, median household income, and race. Asian/Pacific Islanders and Hispanic Whites had lower mortality compared to Non-Hispanic Whites. Cause-specific mortality was associated with both racial and socioeconomic groups. After adjusting for treatment and tumor-related factors, Asian/Pacific and black patients had lower glioblastoma-specific mortality. However, lower median household income and black race were associated with significantly higher non-glioblastoma mortality.
Despite the aggressive nature of glioblastoma, racial and socioeconomic factors influence glioblastoma-specific and non-glioblastoma associated mortality. Our study shows that patient race has an impact on glioblastoma-associated mortality independently of tumor and treatment related factors.

Preterm birth and being born small for gestational age (SGA) are major causes of adverse neonatal outcomes worldwide. To reduce preterm birth and infants born SGA, it is important to understand which women are most at risk and how risk varies within countries. There are few studies estimating the prevalence and risk factors for these conditions in Haiti, particularly in rural regions.
We conducted a prospective cohort study of pregnant women at a rural tertiary care centre in Haiti from May to December 2017. We collected data during interviews and from the medical record. We built multivariable models to identify risk factors for preterm birth and being born SGA among women who had a facility-based delivery.
1089 pregnant women delivered at the hospital and were included in this analysis. Median gestational age at delivery was 38 weeks (IQR 36-40). In multivariable analyses, risk factors for preterm birth included maternal age <20 years (adjusted OR (AOR) 1.76, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.72) and >34 years (AOR 1.46, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.11) and severe hunger in the household (AOR 1.57, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.26). Risk factors for SGA were age >34 years (AOR 1.76, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.59), twin pregnancy (AOR 3.28, 95% CI 1.20 to 8.95) and first pregnancy (AOR 1.57, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.23). Number of prior abortions was associated with reduced risk for SGA (AOR 0.41, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.97).
Food insecurity as a risk factor for preterm birth stands out as an important addition to the understanding of the risk of neonatal morbidity and mortality.

The outcomes of and health care utilization among transferred (TRAN) as compared to directly admitted (DA) patients have been studied primarily using single institution or hospital system data which limits generalizability. We evaluated these outcomes among EGS patients using a national database.
We identified encounters of patients aged ≥18 years with a diagnosis of EGS as defined by the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma in the 2008-2011 Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS). Multivariable regression analyses determined if transfer status independently predicted in-hospital mortality (logistic regression) and morbidity (presence of any complication among those who survived to discharge; logistic regression), cost (log-linear regression), and duration of stay (among those who survived to discharge; log-linear regression) accounting for the NIS sampling design.
We identified 274,145 TRAN (57,885 unweighted) and 10,456,100 DA (2,187,132 unweighted) encounters. On univariate analysis, TRAN patients were more likely to have greater comorbidity scores, have Medicare insurance, and reside in an area with a lesser median household income compared to DA patients (p<0.0001). Mortality was greater in the TRAN vs DA groups (4.4% vs 1.6%; p<0.0001). Morbidity (presence of any complication) was also greater among TRAN patients (38.8% vs 26.1%; p<0.0001). Morbidity among TRAN patients was primarily due to urinary- (13.7%), gastrointestinal- (12.9%), and pulmonary-related (13.3%) complications. Median duration of hospital stay was 4.3 days for TRAN vs 3.0 days for DA (p<0.0001) patients. Median cost was greater for TRAN patients ($8,935 vs $7,167; p<0.0001). Regression analyses determined that after adjustment, TRAN patients had statistically significantly greater mortality, morbidity, and cost as well as longer durations of stay.
EGS patients who are transferred experience increased in-hospital morbidity and mortality as well as increased durations of stay and cost. As the population and age of patients diagnosed with EGS conditions increase while the EGS workforce decreases, the need for inter-hospital transfers will increase. Identifying risk factors associated with worse outcomes among transferred patients can inform the design of initiatives in performance improvement and direct the finite resources available to this vulnerable patient population.",Transferred emergency general surgery patients have high acuity.,How do outcomes and health care utilization differ between transferred and directly admitted emergency general surgery patients?,Analysis of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample data.,"Transferred patients had increased in-hospital morbidity and mortality, longer hospital stay, and higher costs.","Retrospective design, potential selection bias."

Intensive surveillance, active community health education and child health interventions were delivered in 1989-1996; here we assess improvements in under-5 mortality, diarrhea, and pneumonia over this period and 15 years later.
Two prospective open-cohort studies in Oshikhandass from 1989 to 1996 (Study 1) and 2011-2014 (Study 2) enrolled all children under age 60 months. Study staff trained using WHO guidelines, conducted weekly household surveillance and promoted knowledge on causes and management of diarrhea and pneumonia. Information about household characteristics and socioeconomic status was collected. Hurdle models were constructed to examine putative risk factors for diarrhea and pneumonia.
Against a backdrop of considerable change in the socioeconomic status of the community, under-5 mortality, which declined over the course of Study 1 (from 114.3 to 79.5 deaths/1000 live births (LB) between 1989 and 1996), exceeded Sustainable Development Goal 3 by Study 2 (19.8 deaths/ 1000 LB). Reductions in diarrhea prevalence (20.3 to 2.2 days/ Child Year [CY]), incidence (2.1 to 0.5 episodes/ CY), and number of bloody diarrhea episodes (18.6 to 5.2%) seen during Study 1, were sustained in Study 2. Pneumonia incidence was 0.5 episodes /CY in Study 1 and 0.2/CY in Study 2; only 5% of episodes were categorized as severe or very severe in both studies. While no individual factors predicted a statistically significant difference in diarrhea or pneumonia episodes, the combined effect of water, toilet and housing materials was associated with a significant decrease in diarrhea; higher household income was the most protective factor for pneumonia in Study 1.
We report a 4-fold decrease in overall childhood mortality, and a 2-fold decrease in childhood morbidity from diarrhea and pneumonia in a remote rural village in Pakistan between 1989 and 2014. We conclude that significant, sustainable improvements in child health may be achieved through improved socioeconomic status and promoting interactions between locally engaged health workers and the community, but that continued efforts are needed to improve health worker training, supervision, and the rational use of medications.

Describing and decomposing the trend of the concentration of infant mortality among disadvantaged mothers thus provides important clues for improving birth outcomes. We develop the infant mortality disadvantage index (IMDI) to measure such concentration. Using the 1983-2013 Birth Cohort Linked Birth and Infant Death data, we show that although the IMDI-as a measure of mortality inequality-was persistently higher for Blacks than Whites, the trends were different between the two groups. The IMDI declined for Black women; for White women, however, it increased in the 1980s, then plateaued until the early 2000s, and declined thereafter. We then use Das Gupta's decomposition method to assess the contribution of five demographic/social factors (age, education, marriage, fertility, and infant mortality) to the IMDI trend. Nonmarital fertility among women with less than 12 years of education contributed most to Whites' changing IMDI; for Blacks, a shrinking proportion of the less-educated group and declines in infant mortality among disadvantaged mothers contributed to their declining IMDI. These findings explicate links between population-level compositional changes and infant mortality inequality.",,,,,

A baseline census of the whole population of 270,387 households in 51 unions, 451 villages from 7 rural sub-districts in Bangladesh was conducted in 2013. The baseline census determined retrospective, age-specific, and cumulative drowning incidence rates (IR) experienced in the target households in the 12 months prior to the intervention. Beginning in late 2013, creches for drowning prevention were established across the study area. Acceptance into creches was provided and written assent to attend a creche was obtained for all children aged 9-47 months in all participating unions. Playpens were provided to 45,460 of these children, of which 5981 children received only the playpens. All children were followed-up until their 48-month birthday or administrative censoring (fixed timepoint to stop observing the drowning deaths), after a two-year implementation period (2014-2016). Drowning IR were estimated for children and compared to corresponding baseline rates from 2012. Age-specific drowning IR under different ""as treated"" categories (playpen-only, creche-only, and playpen-plus-creche) were compared to the baseline rates experienced by the categorized households prior to intervention.
A total of 3205 creches (average of 7 creches per village) were established, and 116,054 children aged 9-47 months were exposed to the intervention packages. Aggregated drowning IRs between age 0 and 47 were estimated per 100,000 population per year at 86.73 (95% CI: 69.67-107.97) and 43.03 (95% CI: 35.55-52.10) in the baseline and post implementation period, respectively. Risk ratios were 0.40 (95% CI: 0.28-0.57) overall, and 0.34 (95% CI: 0.13-0.90), 0.09 (95% CI: 0.02-0.36), and 0.04 (95% CI: 0.002-0.60) in children under the creche-only, aged, 1, 2, and 3 years old respectively. Inexplicably, drowning rates were statistically significantly higher post-intervention in children 0-11 months. There was no mortality reduction with playpen use (alone or in combination), and this group may actually have had a higher risk of drowning.

We investigated the association between individual wealth and mortality across the adult life course in Sweden.
We studied the Swedish adult population using national registers. The amount of wealth tax paid in 1990 was the main exposure of interest and the cohort was followed up for 18 years. Relative indices of inequality (RII) summarize health inequalities across a population and were calculated for all-cause and cause-specific mortality for six different age groups, stratified by sex, using Poisson regression. Mortality inequalities by wealth were contrasted with those assessed by individual and household income. Attenuation by four other measures of socio-economic position and other covariates was investigated.
Large inequalities in mortality by wealth were observed and their association with mortality remained more stable across the adult life course than inequalities by income-based measures. Men experienced greater inequalities across all ages (e.g. the RII for wealth was 2.58 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.54-2.63) in men aged 55-64 years compared with 2.29 (95% CI 2.24-2.34) for women aged 55-64 years), except among the over 85s. Adjustment for covariates, including four other measures of socio-economic position, led to only modest reductions in the association between wealth and mortality.
Wealth is strongly associated with mortality throughout the adult life course, including early adulthood.

Biological aging is a potential process underlying health conditions related to social disadvantages, which may be present from birth onward.
To evaluate the association of parental socioeconomic status with telomere length (TL) at birth, a marker of biological aging.
This prospective birth cohort study was conducted among 1504 mother-newborn pairs in Belgium recruited between February 1, 2010, and July 1, 2017.
Parental socioeconomic measures, including maternal educational level, occupation, paternal educational level, and neighborhood income based on median annual household income.
Mean relative TL was measured in cord blood and placental tissue. By constructing a principal component, an integrative socioeconomic measure was derived that integrates parental socioeconomic status and neighborhood income. Multivariable adjusted regression analyses were performed to associate the integrative socioeconomic measure and TL at birth.
In 1026 newborns (517 boys; mean [SD] gestational age, 39.2 [1.4] weeks), a higher socioeconomic status was associated with longer cord blood TL and placental TL. Each unit increment in the integrative socioeconomic status measure was associated with 2.1% (95% CI, 0.9%-3.4%; P < .001) longer cord blood TL in boys, while no association was observed for girls (0.5% longer cord blood TL; 95% CI, -0.9% to 1.8%; P = .50). The sex-specific socioeconomic status interaction revealed a stronger association in boys compared with newborn girls (1.6%; 95% CI, 0.02%-3.3%; P = .047 for interaction). In placental tissue, higher socioeconomic status was associated with 1.8% (95% CI, 0.3%-3.3%; P = .02) longer TL in newborn boys but not in girls (0.4% longer TL; 95% CI, -1.2% to 2.0%; P = .63). For placental tissue, no sex and socioeconomic status interaction on TL was observed (1.4%; 95% CI, -0.5% to 3.4%; P = .16 for interaction).
This study suggests that parental socioeconomic status is associated with newborn TL, especially in boys.

On 26 March 2020 we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, WHO Global Index Medicus, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform.
We included all types of studies, in any population, that examined hand cleaning with ash compared to hand cleaning with any other material.
Two review authors independently screened titles and full texts, and one review author extracted outcome data and assessed risk of bias, which another review author double-checked. We used the ROBINS-I tool for observational studies, we used RoB 2.0 for three interventional studies, and we used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We planned to synthesise data with random-effects meta-analyses. Our prespecified outcome measures were overall mortality, number of cases of infections (as defined in the individual studies), severity of infectious disease, harms (as reported in the individual studies), and adherence.
We included 14 studies described in 19 records using eight different study designs, but only one randomised trial. The studies were primarily conducted in rural settings in low- and lower-middle-income countries. Six studies reported outcome data relevant to our review. A retrospective case-control study and a cohort study assessed diarrhoea in children under the age of five years and self-reported reproductive tract symptoms in women, respectively. It was very uncertain whether the rate of hospital contacts for moderate-to-severe diarrhoea in children differed between households that cleaned hands using ash compared with households cleaning hands using soap (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.11; very low-certainty evidence). Similarly, it was very uncertain whether the rate of women experiencing symptoms of reproductive tract infection differed between women cleaning hands with ash compared with cleaning hands using soap (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.86; very low-certainty evidence) or when compared with handwashing with water only or not washing hands (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.96; very low-certainty evidence). Four studies reported on bacteriological counts after hand wash. We rated all four studies at high risk of bias, and we did not synthesise data due to methodological heterogeneity and unclear outcome reporting.

There were 466 486 participants (54% women) aged 40-69 years and without a prior history of cancer of whom 5.5% were regularly using opioids. Use increased with age-group, was more common in females (6.3% v. 4.6%) and 87% of persons using them reported chronic pain. The highest rates of use (~1 in 9) were in people with low household income, who left school <16 years and lived in areas with high deprivation. Amongst 15,032 people who could not work because of ill-health, 1 in 3 were regularly taking opioids. Regular users reported insomnia (88.7%), a recent major recent life event (57.3%) and were much more likely than non-users to rate their health as poor (RR 5.5, 99% CI (4.9, 6.1)).

Pediatric patients less than 18 years of age using ambulance services in one of seven states in India, with a chief complaint of ""shortness of breath"", or a ""fever"" with associated ""difficulty breathing"" or ""cough"", were enrolled prospectively. Patients were excluded if evidence of choking, trauma or fire-related injury, patient was absent on ambulance arrival, or refused transport. Primary exposures included demographic, environmental, and clinical indicators, including hypoxemia and respiratory distress. The primary outcome was 7 and 30-day mortality. Multivariable logistic regression, stratified by transport type, was constructed to estimate associations between demographic and clinical predictors of mortality.

Cumulative mortality at 2, 7, and 30-days was 5.2%, 7.1%, and 7.7%, respectively; with 94 deaths by 30 days. Thirty-day mortality was greatest among those 0-28 days (N = 38,17%); under-5 mortality was 9.8%. In multivariable modeling prehospital oxygen saturation <95% (OR: 3.18 CI: 1.77-5.71) and respiratory distress (OR: 3.72 CI: 2.17-6.36) were the strongest predictors of mortality at 30 days.
This is the first study to detail prehospital predictors of death among pediatric patients with shortness of breath in LMICs. The risk of death is particularly high among neonates and those with documented mild hypoxemia, or respiratory distress. Early recognition of critically ill children, targeted prehospital interventions, and diversion to higher level of care may help to mitigate the mortality burden in this population.",,,,,

In this study, the authors used a large-population national database to compare endoscopic surgery (ES) to nonendoscopic surgery (NES) for the surgical management of PA.
The National Cancer Database was queried for all patients diagnosed with histologically confirmed PA who underwent resection between 2010 and 2016 in which the surgical approach was specified. Due to database limitations, microsurgery and craniotomy were both categorized as NES.
Of 30,488 identified patients, 16,373 (53.7%) underwent ES and 14,115 (46.3%) underwent NES. There was a significant increase in the use of ES over time (OR 1.16, p < 0.01). Furthermore, there was a significant temporal increase in ES approach for tumors ≥ 2 cm (OR 1.17, p < 0.01). Compared to NES, patients who underwent ES were younger (p = 0.01), were treated at academic centers (p < 0.01), lived a greater distance from their treatment site (p < 0.01), had smaller tumors (p < 0.01), had greater medical comorbidity burden (p = 0.04), had private insurance (p < 0.01), and had a higher household income (p < 0.01). After propensity score matching to control for age, tumor size, Charlson/Deyo score, and type of treatment center, patients who underwent ES had a shorter length of hospital stay (LOS) (3.9 ± 4.9 days vs 4.3 ± 5.4 days, p < 0.01), although rates of gross-total resection (GTR; p = 0.34), adjuvant radiotherapy (p = 0.41), and 90-day mortality (p = 0.45) were similar. On multivariate logistic regression, African American race (OR 0.85, p < 0.01) and tumor size ≥ 2 cm (OR 0.89, p = 0.01) were negative predictors of receiving ES, whereas diagnosis in more recent years (OR 1.16, p < 0.01), greater Charlson/Deyo score (OR 1.10, p = 0.01), receiving treatment at an academic institution (OR 1.67, p < 0.01) or at a treatment site ≥ 20 miles away (OR 1.17, p < 0.01), having private insurance (OR 1.09, p = 0.01), and having a higher household income (OR 1.11, p = 0.01) were predictive of receiving ES. Compared to the ES cohort, patients who started with ES and converted to NES (n = 293) had a higher ratio of nonwhite race (p < 0.01), uninsured insurance status (p < 0.01), longer LOS (p < 0.01), and higher rates of GTR (p = 0.04).
There is an increasing trend toward ES for PA resection including its use for larger tumors. Although ES may result in shorter LOS compared to NES, rates of GTR, need for adjuvant therapy, and short-term mortality may be similar.

The purpose of this study was to examine the association of annual household income and cardiovascular outcomes in individuals with AF.
We analysed administrative claims for individuals with AF from 2009 to 2015 captured by a health claims database. We categorised estimates of annual household income as <$40 000; $40-$59 999; $60-$74 999; $75-$99 999; and ≥$100 000. Covariates included demographics, education, cardiovascular disease risk factors, comorbid conditions and anticoagulation. We examined event rates by income category and in multivariable-adjusted models in reference to the highest income category (≥$100 000).
Our analysis included 336 736 individuals (age 72.7±11.9 years; 44.5% women; 82.6% white, 8.4% black, 7.0% Hispanic and 2.1% Asian) with AF followed for median (25th and 75th percentile) of 1.5 (95% CI 0.6 to 3.0) years. We observed an inverse association between income and heart failure and myocardial infarction (MI) with evidence of progressive risk across decreased income categories. Individuals with household income <$40 000 had the greatest risk for heart failure (HR 1.17; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.30) and MI (HR 1.18; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.41) compared with those with income ≥$100 000.

While healthcare needs-based segmentation is a promising approach to efficiently assessing and responding to healthcare needs at the population level, it is not clear how available schemes perform in the context of community-based surveys administered by non-medically trained personnel. The aim of this prospective cohort, community setting study is to evaluate 4 segmentation schemes in terms of practicality and predictive validity for future health outcomes and service utilization.
A cohort was identified from a cross-sectional health and social characteristics survey of Singapore public rental housing residents aged 60 years and above. Baseline survey data was used to assign individuals into segments as defined by 4 predefined population segmentation schemes developed in Singapore, Delaware, Lombardy and North-West London. From electronic data records, mortality, hospital admissions, emergency department visits, and specialist outpatient clinic visits were assessed for 180 days after baseline segment assignment and compared to segment membership for each segmentation scheme.
Of 1324 residents contacted, 928 agreed to participate in the survey (70% response). All subjects could be assigned an exclusive segment for each segmentation scheme. Individuals in more severe segments tended to have lower quality of life as assessed by the EQ-5D Index for health utility. All population segmentation schemes were observed to exhibit an ability to differentiate different levels of mortality and healthcare utilization.
It is practical to assign individuals to healthcare needs-based population segments through community surveys by non-medically trained personnel. The resulting segments for all 4 schemes evaluated in this way have an ability to predict health outcomes and utilization over the medium term (180 days), with significant overlap for some segments. Healthcare needs-based segmentation schemes which are designed to guide action hold particular promise for promoting efficient allocation of services to meet the needs of salient population groups. Further evaluation is needed to determine if these schemes also predict responsiveness to interventions to meet needs implied by segment membership.",Healthcare needs-based segmentation can help assess and respond to population healthcare needs.,How do different population segmentation schemes perform in predicting health outcomes and service utilization?,Prospective cohort study evaluating 4 segmentation schemes in a community setting.,"All schemes could predict health outcomes and utilization, with potential for efficient allocation of services.","Limited to a specific cohort and setting, further validation needed in diverse populations."

We used descriptive statistics to characterize infections within a retrospective cohort characterized previously. We used multivariable logistic regression models to assess potential risk factors for infection and associations with key outcomes such as short-term mortality and length of stay.
The study cohort of 1112 patients included 33% women with a mean age of 56 ± 10 years. Infections were common (20%), with respiratory and urinary tract infections the most frequent. We did not observe a difference in the incidence of infection on admission based on patient demographic factors such as race/ethnicity or estimated household income.

Previous work has focused on the impact of socioeconomic status on mortality, hospital stay, or complications. However, individuals with low socioeconomic status are also likely to have fewer supports to facilitate them remaining at home after hospital discharge. Thus, such patients may be less likely to return home over the short and intermediate term after major surgery. The newly validated outcome, days alive and out of hospital, may be highly suited to evaluating the impact of socioeconomic status on this postdischarge period. The study aimed to determine the association of socioeconomic status with short and intermediate term postoperative recovery as measured by days alive and out of hospital.
The authors evaluated data from 724,459 adult patients who had one of 13 elective major noncardiac surgical procedures between 2006 and 2017. Socioeconomic status was measured by median neighborhood household income (categorized into quintiles). Primary outcome was days alive and out of hospital at 30 days, while secondary outcomes included days alive and out of hospital at 90 and 180 days, and 30-day mortality.
Compared to the highest income quintile, individuals in the lowest quintile had higher unadjusted risks of postoperative complications (6,049 of 121,099 [5%] vs. 6,216 of 160,495 [3.9%]) and 30-day mortality (731 of 121,099 [0.6%] vs. 701 of 160,495 [0.4%]) and longer mean postoperative length of stay (4.9 vs. 4.4 days). From lowest to highest income quintile, the mean adjusted days alive and out of hospital at 30 days after surgery varied between 24.5 to 24.9 days.
Low socioeconomic status is associated with fewer days alive and out of hospital after surgery.

However, these gains have not been shared equally across all population groups. Socioeconomic disparities exist, though varied methodologies and data sources have made it difficult to ascertain changes over time in Canada.
The 1996 and 2011 Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohorts, with a five-year mortality follow-up, were used to estimate the LE of the household population at ages 25 and 65, according to individual-level education and income. Health status was measured by the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 instrument in two national population health surveys and was used to adjust LE to estimate health-adjusted life expectancy (HALE). Disparities in LE and HALE, and differences between cohorts, were examined.
LE, HALE and the ratio of HALE to LE were greater at higher levels of education or income. A stepwise gradient was also observed by level of education within and across income quintiles, with people in the lowest combined education and income categories at the greatest disadvantage. Disparities were wider in the 2011 cohort compared with the 1996 cohort, but not necessarily to the same extent for both sexes or at different ages.
In Canada, education-related and income-related disparities in life and health expectancy persist and may be wider than they were in the past.

To examine the associations of CRC screening and modalities with CRC incidence and mortality by race and SES.
This cohort study used data from the Southern Community Cohort Study, which enrolled more than 85 000 participants from community health centers or stratified random sampling of the general population in 12 states in the southeastern United States. The present study included data from cohort members who were eligible for CRC screening as recommended by expert organizations based on age and family history. Participants completed questionnaires from 2002 to 2009 and were contacted again from 2008 to 2012. Linkages to state cancer registries and the National Death Index as of December 31, 2016, identified incident CRC and vital status. Data analysis was performed from January 1, 2018, to October 30, 2019.
Incident CRC (n = 632) and mortality (n = 10 003). Cox proportional hazards regression models evaluated associations between screening modalities and CRC risk and mortality. Information on fecal occult blood test use was only obtained on the follow-up questionnaire. Self-identified race was measured as African American/black, white, or other, and SES was defined by household income.
This study included 47 596 participants (median baseline age, 54 years [interquartile range, 10 years]; 32 185 [67.6%] African American; 28 884 [60.7%] female; and 26 075 [54.8%] with household income <$15 000). A total of 24 432 participants (63.9%) had never undergone CRC testing at baseline. The CRC testing assessed at baseline and follow-up interviews was associated with significant CRC risk reduction (hazard ratio [HR], 0.55; 95% CI, 0.44-0.70 for ever colonoscopy at baseline). Results were similar in analyses stratified by race (African American: HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.50-0.85; white: HR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.27-0.70) and household income (<$15 000: HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.46-0.86, ≥$15 000: HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.35-0.69). Ever sigmoidoscopy at baseline was associated with CRC risk reduction (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.51-0.87), and undergoing fecal occult blood test in the interval between baseline and follow-up interview was associated with CRC risk reduction (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.57-0.98). Inverse associations were also observed between CRC mortality and receipt of colonoscopy (HR for women, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.21-0.73; HR for men, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.40-1.18) and sigmoidoscopy (HR for women, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.16-0.85; HR for men, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.46-1.47); however, the association did not extend to fecal occult blood test (HR for women, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.62-1.70; HR for men, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.55-1.93).
In this study, CRC test rates were low among African American individuals and those with low SES.

Previous studies of mortality inequalities have relied on area-based measures of socioeconomic indicators. A new series of census-mortality linked datasets has been created in Canada to quantify mortality inequalities based on individual-level data and examine whether these inequalities have changed over time.
This study used the 1991, 1996, 2001, 2006, and 2011 Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohorts (CanCHECs) with five years of mortality follow-up. It estimated age-standardized mortality rates by sex according to income quintile and highest level of educational attainment categories for the household population aged 25 or older. Absolute and relative measures of mortality inequality were also estimated.
Men had a greater reduction in mortality rates over time compared with women, regardless of income or education level. Absolute income-related mortality inequality decreased for men but increased for women over time, while relative income-related inequality increased for both sexes. Education-related mortality inequality for women followed the same pattern as income, though the absolute mortality difference for men remained roughly unchanged over the period.
Mortality inequalities by income and education persist in Canada, and have increased for women. Further research to determine the mechanisms underlying these trends could help address the complex challenge of reducing health inequalities in Canada.",,,,,

Interpregnancy interval is a key risk factor of interest, because it is modifiable. We aimed to investigate whether there is a causal relationship between the length of interpregnancy interval and risk of subsequent stillbirth.
We used Demographic and Health Surveys (2002-18) from 58 LMICs to study reproductive histories of women and to identify livebirths and stillbirths in the preceding 5 years. Countries were selected on the basis of the availability of interpregnancy interval data and other covariates of interest (age, education, urban or rural residence, and wealth) in surveys done since 2002. Exclusion criteria were being nulliparous, having missing parity data, and not having had at least two births (livebirth or stillbirth) in the 5 years before the survey. We combined two analytic approaches: one that analyses intervals between all births and another that analyses intervals within mothers. We report stratified estimates for the first, second, and third intervals, controlling for all past birth outcomes and intervals in a 5-year period, and other socioeconomic covariates. We also explored effect heterogeneity across key cohort subgroups.
Between July, 1997, and April, 2018, we identified 716 478 births from 338 223 women in 123 Demographic and Health Surveys from 58 LMICs, of which 9647 were stillbirths. Intervals of less than 6 months were associated with an increased risk of stillbirth in the between-mother models when considering the first interval (risk difference [RD] 0·0096, 95% CI 0·008-0·011). This association was slightly attenuated when considering only the second interval (RD 0·0054, 95% CI 0·0010 to 0·0099) and substantially attenuated when considering only the third interval (0·0007, -0·037 to 0·039). Within-mother modelling showed a null association with intervals of 24-59 months when considering the first and second (RD 0·007, 95% CI -0·001 to 0·016) and first and third (0·040, -0·422 to 0·501) intervals.
Although interpregnancy intervals of less than 12 months were associated with increased risk of stillbirth, these effects were attenuated when considering second and third intervals, suggesting the association in the first interval might not be causal. Future studies should use generalisable cohorts with longitudinal data, and report estimates stratified by birth order.

Register-based national cohort study using multiple Cox regression.
The population of 1,263,795 Danish children live-born 1997-2016 who survived until date of first discharge to the home after birth was followed from that date until death, emigration, 5 years of age or 31 December 2016.
(A) Mortality hazard ratios (HRs) among all children, (B) mortality HRs among children without severe chronic disease, and (C) mortality HRs among children without severe chronic disease or asthma.
In the total population (1,947 deaths) severe chronic disease was associated with mortality HR = 15.28 (95% CI: 13.77-16.95). In children without severe chronic-disease (719 deaths) other somatic risk factors were immature birth HR = 3.40 (1.92-6.02), maternal smoking HR = 1.84 (1.55-2.18) and low birth weight HR = 1.74 (1.21-2.51). Socioeconomic risk factors for mortality included: maternal age < 25 years HR = 1.91 (1.38-2.64) compared to > 35 years (similar for 30-35 years and 25-29 years), lowest vs. highest family income tertile HR = 1.76 (1.23-2.51), not living with both parents HR = 1.63 (1.25-2.13), maternal unemployment HR = 1.54 (1.12-2.12), presence of siblings HR = 1.44 (1.20-1.71) and secondary vs. tertiary parental education HR = 1.33 (1.07-1.65) for fathers and HR = 1.23 (1.01-1.52) for mothers. Factors not found to be associated with child mortality in this population included presence of asthma HR = 1.29 (0.83-1.98) and non-Danish ethnicity HR = 0.98 (0.70-1.37).
Childhood death after discharge to the home after birth and before 5 years of age is a very rare event in Denmark. This 'post-discharge' mortality was heavily associated with severe chronic disease. In children without severe chronic disease, immature birth, maternal smoking and certain socioeconomic characteristics were noticeable risk factors. Mortality may possibly be decreased by focusing on vulnerable groups.",,,,,

However, little is known about the relations of OSA with acute asthma severity in hospitalized patients.
To investigate the association of OSA with acute asthma severity.
This is a retrospective cohort study (2010-2013) using State Inpatient Databases from 8 geographically diverse states in the United States. The outcomes were markers of acute severity, including mechanical ventilation use, hospital length of stay, and in-hospital mortality. To determine the association of interest, we fit multivariable logistic regression models, adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, primary insurance, household income, patient residence, comorbidities, hospital state, and hospitalization year. We repeated the analysis for children aged 6 to 17 years.
Among 73,408 adult patients hospitalized for acute asthma, 10.3% had OSA. Coexistent OSA was associated with a significantly higher risk of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation use (14.9% vs 3.1%; unadjusted odds ratio, 6.48; 95% CI, 5.88-7.13; adjusted odds ratio, 5.20; 95% CI, 4.65-5.80), whereas coexistent OSA was not significantly associated with the risk of invasive mechanical ventilation use. Patients with OSA had 37% longer hospital length of stay (unadjusted incidence rate ratio, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.33-1.40); this significant association persisted in the multivariable model (incidence rate ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.10-1.17). The in-hospital mortality did not significantly differ between groups. These findings were consistent in both obesity and nonobesity groups and in 27,935 children.

Our primary objectives were (1) evaluation of The Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36) results; (2) comparison with results of patients who completed the Child Health Questionnaire-Child Form 87 (CHQ-CF87) previously, or the PedsQL Generic Core Scales (PedsQL) survey subsequently; and (3) determination of factors associated with SF-36 domains.
Survivors from the d-TGA Congenital Heart Surgeons' Society cohort (1985-1989) completed the SF-36 (2010) as a measure of FHS (n = 210; age 21-26 years). Patient characteristics, medical history, psychosocial factors, and previous adolescent CHQ-CF87 FHS assessment (2000) were explored for association with SF-36 domains, along with comparison with recent PedsQL data (2017).
Patients scored themselves the same/higher than published normative data in 10 of 10 SF-36 summary scores/domains and similar in 5 of 6 PedsQL summary scores/domains. Factors commonly associated with lower summary scores/domains of the SF-36 were presence of cardiac symptoms, heart condition impacting physical activity/overall health/quality of life, unemployment, and lack of postsecondary education. Less commonly associated factors were lower birth weight, greater total medication number, female sex, shorter procedure-free interval, poor health knowledge, lower family income, younger age at SF-36, living with parents, and being married. These factors accounted for 17% to 47% of the variation in FHS summary scores/domains. FHS was minimally related to d-TGA morphology and repair type.
Patients with d-TGA surviving into adulthood, regardless of morphology or repair type, can primarily expect normal FHS. Addressing the challenges of patients with d-TGA entering adulthood requires consideration of psychosocial factors and clinical management.",,,,,

To document the proportion of current adult racial health disparities rooted in early-life factors, I use nationally representative longitudinal data from the PSID spanning four decades. The results indicate that racial differences in early life neighborhood conditions and family background characteristics play a substantial role in explaining racial disparities in hypertension through at least age 50. Contemporaneous socioeconomic factors account for relatively little of the racial disparities in this health condition in adulthood. Second, I match the Panel Study of Income Dynamics data to county-level data on Medicaid expenditures during these cohorts' childhoods, and provide new causal evidence on the long-run returns to childhood Medicaid spending: Medicaid-induced increases in access to public health insurance led to significant reductions in the likelihood of low birth weight, increased educational attainment and adult income, and reduced adult mortality and the annual incidence of health problems.",,,,,

There are no empirical studies of premature mortality in children with neurological impairments in Africa. This study estimated the risk of premature mortality in children with neurological impairments and identified risk factors and causes of death.
We did a cohort study based on a two-stage epidemiological survey in the Kilifi Health and Demographic Surveillance System (Kilifi, Kenya). Study participants were children aged 6-9 years. In the first stage, five trained field workers administered a low-cost screening tool to a random sample of households. In the second stage, we assessed for neurological impairments in five domains (epilepsy, cognitive impairments, vision impairments, hearing impairments, and motor impairments) using comprehensive clinical evaluation and extensive neuropsychological assessments. From the two-stage survey we identified a cohort of children with neurological impairment and a cohort of matched controls. We also enrolled an age-matched sample from the general population. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Mortality rates, standardised mortality ratio (SMR), and hazard ratios (HR) for risk factors were estimated and causes of death identified.
We enrolled 306 children with neurological impairment, 9912 survey controls, and 22 873 age-matched participants from the general population, and followed up the cohorts between June 1, 2001, and Aug 31, 2018. Median follow-up was 14·5 years (IQR 8·6-17·2). 11 (3·9%) of 284 children with neurological impairment, 92 (1·0%) of 9009 controls, and 272 (1·2%) of 22 873 participants in the general population sample died during the follow-up. Overall mortality rates were 309·8 per 100 000 person-years of observation (95% CI 126·7-492·9) in children with neurological impairment, 80·8 per 100 000 person-years of observation (64·3-97·3) in controls, and 98·8 per 100 000 person-years of observation (87·1-110·6) in the general population sample (mortality rate ratio 3·83, 95% CI 2·05-7·16, p<0·001, compared with controls; 3·13, 1·71-5·72, p<0·001, compared with the general population). Mortality risk in children with neurological impairment was not dependent on the severity of impairment (p=0·291) nor on a specific neurological impairment domain (p=0·205). The overall risk of death adjusted for age and sex was higher in children with neurological impairment compared with controls (HR 4·24, 95% CI 2·26-7·94, p=0·002). An SMR of 3·15 (95% CI 1·66-5·49) was obtained after using the general population sample as the reference for indirect standardisation. In multivariable risk factor analysis, developmental delay (adjusted HR 18·92, 95% CI 2·23-160·44, p=0·007) and severe malnutrition (20·92, 3·14-139·11, p=0·002) increased the risk of mortality in children with neurological impairment. Infections such as HIV/AIDS and accidents were common among all decedents.
The risk of premature mortality was higher in children diagnosed with neurological impairments compared with the general population and was increased by developmental delay and severe malnutrition. Child development and nutritional status should be assessed in all children in LMICs and tailored interventions started to improve outcomes.

A retrospective cohort study with difference-in-differences analysis using individual-level perinatal outcome data from the Dutch Perinatal Registry 2003-2014 linked to Central Bureau of Statistics data of migration background and individual disposable household income.
The programme consisted of perinatal health promotion, risk selection and risk-guided pregnancy care, and a new primary care child birth centre. The programme was implemented during 2009-2012.
We compared trends in perinatal mortality, preterm delivery and small-for-gestational-age births between targeted urban neighbourhoods in Rotterdam (n=61 415) and all other urban neighbourhoods in the Netherlands (n=881 202). The effect of the programme was modelled as a change in trend of each perinatal outcome in the treatment group post intervention compared with the control population from January 2010 onwards. All analyses were adjusted for maternal age, parity, ethnicity and individual-level low socioeconomic status (SES). We also conducted a stratified analysis by SES.
During 2003-2014, downward trends in perinatal mortality (adjusted OR (aOR) 0.9439 per year, 95% CI 0.9362 to 0.9517), preterm birth (aOR 0.9970 per year, 95% CI 0.9944 to 0.9997) and small-for-gestational-age births (aOR 0.9809 per year, 95% CI 0.9787 to 0.9831) in the entire study population were observed. No demonstrable changes in these trends were found in the intervention group after the programme had started. The stratified analyses by SES showed no changes in trends post intervention in both strata either.
The programme had no demonstrable effects on perinatal outcomes. The intervention may not have reached a sufficient proportion of the population or has provided too little contrast to the widespread attention for inequalities in pregnancy outcomes occurring simultaneously in the Netherlands.",,,,,

Using an institutional perinatal database from two hospitals in Houston, Texas, women with nonanomalous singletons delivering after 24 weeks of gestation between August 2011 and June 2018 were included. To evaluate the possible association of hurricane landfall with pregnancy outcomes, gravid women delivering within 280 days (40 weeks of gestation) on or after August 25, 2017 (the day of hurricane landfall) were categorized as exposed, and women who delivered before August 25, 2017, were the reference group. Composite maternal morbidity included any of the following: hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, chorioamnionitis, endometritis, blood transfusion, peripartum hysterectomy, maternal critical care admission, pulmonary edema, or maternal death. Composite neonatal morbidity included any of the following: 5-minute Apgar score 3 or less, respiratory distress syndrome, use of ventilator or continuous positive airway pressure, suspected newborn sepsis, seizure, stillbirth, or neonatal death.

The Healthcare Utilization Project National Inpatient Sample was used to identify patients who had adrenal metastases (ADM) and who underwent ADMX from 2007 to 2011. Patients were identified by ICD-9-CM diagnosis and procedure codes. Predictor variables included sex, race, median household income, and primary insurance payer. Primary outcomes included receiving an ADMX and same hospitalization mortality. Secondary outcomes included length of stay, infection, cardiac, pulmonary, and renal complications. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify statistical associations.
32,331 ADM and 1070 ADMX patients identified in the database. Despite similar comorbidities, Black patients had 0.30 (95% CI 0.21-0.41) lower odds to receive an ADMX compared to White patients.

The Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study overcomes these limitations by using similar methods to prospectively measure the effect of modifiable risk factors on cardiovascular disease and mortality across 21 countries (spanning five continents) grouped by different economic levels.
In this multinational, prospective cohort study, we examined associations for 14 potentially modifiable risk factors with mortality and cardiovascular disease in 155 722 participants without a prior history of cardiovascular disease from 21 high-income, middle-income, or low-income countries (HICs, MICs, or LICs). The primary outcomes for this paper were composites of cardiovascular disease events (defined as cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure) and mortality. We describe the prevalence, hazard ratios (HRs), and population-attributable fractions (PAFs) for cardiovascular disease and mortality associated with a cluster of behavioural factors (ie, tobacco use, alcohol, diet, physical activity, and sodium intake), metabolic factors (ie, lipids, blood pressure, diabetes, obesity), socioeconomic and psychosocial factors (ie, education, symptoms of depression), grip strength, and household and ambient pollution. Associations between risk factors and the outcomes were established using multivariable Cox frailty models and using PAFs for the entire cohort, and also by countries grouped by income level. Associations are presented as HRs and PAFs with 95% CIs.
Between Jan 6, 2005, and Dec 4, 2016, 155 722 participants were enrolled and followed up for measurement of risk factors. 17 249 (11·1%) participants were from HICs, 102 680 (65·9%) were from MICs, and 35 793 (23·0%) from LICs. Approximately 70% of cardiovascular disease cases and deaths in the overall study population were attributed to modifiable risk factors. Metabolic factors were the predominant risk factors for cardiovascular disease (41·2% of the PAF), with hypertension being the largest (22·3% of the PAF). As a cluster, behavioural risk factors contributed most to deaths (26·3% of the PAF), although the single largest risk factor was a low education level (12·5% of the PAF). Ambient air pollution was associated with 13·9% of the PAF for cardiovascular disease, although different statistical methods were used for this analysis. In MICs and LICs, household air pollution, poor diet, low education, and low grip strength had stronger effects on cardiovascular disease or mortality than in HICs.
Most cardiovascular disease cases and deaths can be attributed to a small number of common, modifiable risk factors. While some factors have extensive global effects (eg, hypertension and education), others (eg, household air pollution and poor diet) vary by a country's economic level. Health policies should focus on risk factors that have the greatest effects on averting cardiovascular disease and death globally, with additional emphasis on risk factors of greatest importance in specific groups of countries.

Population-based data on determinants and proportions of children born preterm are limited, especially from low-income countries. This study aimed at assessing time trends and social, reproductive and environmental determinants of preterm births based on a population-based pregnancy cohort over 25 years in rural Bangladesh.
In this cohort study in Matlab, a rural area in Bangladesh, we used data from the Health and Demographic Surveillance System from 1990 to 2014. Gestational age at birth was based on the reported last menstrual period and verified by ultrasound assessments. Preterm birth proportions were assessed within strata of social and reproductive characteristics, and time series analysis was performed with decomposition for trend and seasonality. We also determined the prevented fractions of preterm birth reduction associated with social and demographic changes during the follow-up period.
Analyses were based on 63 063 live births. Preterm birth decreased from 29% (95% CI 28.6 to 30.1) in 1990-1994 to 11% (95% CI 10.5 to 11.6) in 2010-2014. Low education, older age and multi-parity were associated with higher proportions of preterm births across the study period. Preterm births had a marked seasonal variation. A rapid increase in women's educational level and decrease in parity were associated with the decline in preterm births, and 27% of the reduction observed from 1990 to 2014 could be attributed to these educational and reproductive changes.
The reduction in preterm birth was to a large extent associated with the sociodemographic transition, especially changes in maternal education and parity. The persistent seasonal variation in the proportion of preterm birth may reflect the environmental stressors for pregnant women across the study period. Continued investments in girls' education and family planning programmes may contribute to further reduction of preterm births in Bangladesh.",Preterm birth is a major cause of under-five mortality.,What are the time trends and determinants of preterm births in rural Bangladesh?,"Cohort study in Matlab, Bangladesh, using Health and Demographic Surveillance System data from 1990-2014.","Preterm birth decreased over 25 years, associated with sociodemographic changes like education and parity.","Relies on reported last menstrual period for gestational age, potential recall bias, limited to rural Bangladesh."

We therefore evaluated the joint association of household income and medication adherence with death and cardiovascular disease in patients newly treated for hypertension. Methods and Results This was a nationwide cohort study using the Korean National Health Insurance database. We included 1 651 564 individuals, aged 30 to 80 years, with newly treated hypertension and no prior cardiovascular disease and followed them for 10 years. Main exposures were household income in quintiles and adherence to antihypertensive medication, estimated by medication possession ratio: good (≥0.8), moderate (0.5 to <0.8), or poor (<0.5). The primary outcomes were all-cause and cardiovascular deaths. Higher mortality risk was observed in patients with low income (adjusted hazard ratio=1.50, 99% CI=1.46-1.53; lowest versus highest quintile) and poor medication adherence (adjusted hazard ratio=1.66, 99% CI=1.63-1.68; poor versus good adherence). When compared with the highest-income and good-adherence group, adjusted hazard ratio (99% CI) of death was 1.56 (1.52-1.61) for highest-income poor-adherers, 1.46 (1.41-1.51) for lowest-income good-adherers, and 2.46 (2.38-2.54) for lowest-income poor-adherers (P for interaction <0.001). Conclusions Low socioeconomic status and poor adherence to antihypertensive medication are associated with increased mortality and cardiovascular disease risks, but patients with low income are subject to larger excess risks by nonadherence. This highlights the potential importance of promoting medication adherence for risk reduction, especially in low-income patients with hypertension.",Low socioeconomic status and poor medication adherence are associated with increased morbidity and mortality in hypertension patients.,What is the joint association of household income and medication adherence with death and cardiovascular disease in newly treated hypertension patients?,"Nationwide cohort study in Korea using National Health Insurance database, analyzing 1,651,564 individuals with hypertension.","Low income and poor medication adherence were associated with increased mortality and cardiovascular disease risks, with larger effects in low-income patients.","Retrospective study, potential unmeasured confounders, limited to Korean population."

Epub 2019 Aug 9.,Celhay P,Lancet Glob Health,2019,2019/08/14,,,10.1016/S2214-109X(19)30326-2,"On Dec 1, 2006, Mexico's public health-care insurance scheme, Seguro Popular, implemented the Medical Insurance Century XXI (SMSXXI) programme, to provide insurance to children younger than 5 years without social security. SMSXXI aims to increase access to health services, decrease out-of-pocket health expenses (OOPHE), and reduce health inequities. SMSXXI covers uninsured, primarily low-income, populations who might be most at risk of the financial and health consequences of costly medical interventions.
We assessed the effects of SMSXXI on health outcomes and financial protection for Mexico's children using multiple nationally representative surveys and administrative data sources spanning 2001-16. The identification of effects relied on detailed hospital-level affiliation data mapping the geographical expansion of SMSXXI's coverage across the country over time. The units of analysis included hospitals, households, and children. Primary outcomes were neonatal and infant mortality, self-reported morbidity (health status, influenza, and diarrhoea), and child's height. Secondary outcomes were OOPHE, hospital discharges, and quality of service provision. Effects controlled for fixed and time-variant confounders using double-difference and triple-difference estimation strategies. Where feasible, we also estimated effects using exogenous variation in programme eligibility rules that limited enrolment in SMSXXI to children born after Dec 1, 2006.
SMSXXI was not associated with early (<1 week) neonatal mortality, but was associated with a reduction in late (<28 days) neonatal mortality by 0·139 deaths per 1000 livebirths (95% CI 0·032-0·246), or 7% (2-12) relative to the comparison base of 1·98 deaths per 1000 livebirths in 2006. SMSXI was associated with a reduction in infant mortality from conditions covered by the programme by 0·147 deaths per 1000 livebirths (0·023-0·271), or 5% (1-10) relative to the comparison base of 2·73 deaths per 1000 livebirths. The effects were largest in high baseline mortality areas. Long-term health effects, 8 years after the onset of SMSXXI, were reflected in a 0·434 cm (0·404-0·459) height increase for birth cohorts exposed to the programme and an average effect on height of 0·879 cm (0·821-0·932) for low-income populations. About 3-6 years after SMSXXI started, children reported having better health status and lower incidence of influenza and diarrhoea. The programme led to a 14% reduction (7-28) in OOPHE, primarily from hospital-related expenses. No effects were detected on hospital discharges, suggesting that SMSXXI might not have increased use.
SMSXXI promoted access to covered interventions and encouraged better primary care. The programme also promoted increased supply and quality of care by improving human and physical resources sensitive to unmet needs. Increased resource availability and improved supply of health care, rather than increased use, contributed to reduce infant mortality and improved long-term health as proxied by self-reported morbidity and child height. Consistent with the programme's focus on uninsured and low-income populations, the effects on mortality, long-term health status, and OOPHE were concentrated in vulnerable groups.

A cluster randomized controlled intervention trial evaluating child resiliency and the effects of home visiting in township neighborhoods from pregnancy through 5 years postbirth.
The population of pregnant women in 24 matched neighborhoods were recruited and randomized by neighborhood to a standard care condition (n = 594) or a paraprofessional home visiting intervention condition (n = 644). Mothers and children were assessed at 2 weeks, 6, 18, 36, and 60 months postbirth (92-84% follow-up; 10.2% mortality). Resilient children were identified based on consistently meeting global standards for growth, cognitive functioning, and behavior. Maternal HIV status (n = 354 MLH; n = 723 mothers without HIV MWOH), intervention condition, maternal risks, caretaking, sociodemographic characteristics, and neighborhood were examined as predictors of child resiliency over time using analysis of variance, chi-square analyses, and Fisher's exact tests, where appropriate.
None of HIV-seropositive children (n = 17) were resilient; 19% of 345 HIV-exposed but uninfected children of MLH were resilient, a rate very similar to the 16% among MWOH. Resiliency was significantly associated with lower income, food security, not having a live-in partner, and the absence of maternal risk (i.e., not being depressed, using alcohol, or being a victim of intimate partner violence). Being randomized to a home visiting intervention, maternal breastfeeding for at least 3 months and attending a preschool crèche were also unrelated to resiliency. Although matched pairs of neighborhoods had similar rates of resilient children, resiliency varied significantly by neighborhood with rates ranging from 9.5 to 27%.
We set a new standard to define resiliency, as consistently recommended by theoreticians. Although seropositive children are not resilient, uninfected children of MLH are as resilient as their peers of MWOH. Typical protective factors (e.g., home visiting, breastfeeding, preschool) were unrelated to resiliency over the first 5 years of life.

The study assessed the pattern of intake and the factors that influence daily intake of commonly available fruits and vegetables in economically disadvantaged South African communities.
This is a cross-sectional study nested on an ongoing longitudinal study in South Africa. Two communities (a rural and urban) of low socio-economic status were purposely selected from two of the nine provinces. A sample of 535 participants aged 30-75 years was randomly selected from the longitudinal cohort of 1220; 411 (78%) women. Data were collected using validated food frequency and structured interviewer-administered questionnaires. Descriptive and multivariate regression analysis were undertaken.
A higher proportion of participants in the urban township compared to their rural community counterparts had purchased fruits (93% vs. 51%) and vegetables (62% vs. 56%) either daily or weekly. Only 37.8% of the participants consumed at least two portions of commonly available fruits and vegetables daily, with no differences in the two communities. Daily/weekly purchase of sugar sweetened beverages (SSBs) was associated with daily intake of fruits and vegetables (p = 0.014). Controlling for age and gender, analysis showed that those who spent R1000 (USD71.4) and more on groceries monthly compared to those who spent less, and those who travelled with a personal vehicle to purchase groceries (compared to those who took public transport) were respectively 1.6 times (AOR, 95% CI: 1.05-2.44; p = 0.030) and 2.1 times (AOR, 95% CI: 1.06-4.09; p = 0.003) more likely to consume at least two or more portions of fruits and vegetables daily. Those who purchased SSBs daily or weekly were less likely (AOR, 95% CI: 0.54, 0.36-0.81, p = 0.007) to consume two or more portions of fruits and vegetables daily.

Retrospective cohort study using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database.
Demographics, tumor characteristics, location, stage at diagnosis, treatment, and survival data for 1,365 patients diagnosed with sinonasal cancers were extracted from the SEER database. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.5. The Fine and Grey method was used to assess covariate impacts.
Medicaid patients were more likely to live in counties with lower educational levels (8.32% vs. 6.46% below ninth grade education, P < .0001) and lower median household incomes ($56,316 vs. $60,284, P = .0004). Medicaid patients presented with later (T3-T4) stage disease compared to other insurances (P = .0007) and larger tumor size (P = .011). Medicaid patients were less likely to have surgery recommended (P = .0017) or receive surgery as part of their treatment (P = .0033). Analysis of histology-specific 5-year survival rates were lower for Medicaid patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCCA) (P = .016).
This is the first and largest study to examine how education and insurance status may impact treatment and outcomes in sinonasal cancers.

We analyzed the electronic medical records of patients who presented to our institution with SCA between 2000 and 2012 and were discharged alive. Patients were stratified into quartiles by median household income of their home zip code. Baseline characteristics of patients were compared by income quartiles. The impact of SES on mortality was assessed using a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model incorporating all unbalanced covariates.

Based on data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study and survival analysis models, we show that maternal education is related to children's life expectancy - even after controlling for children's own level of education. This applies equally to daughters and sons as well as to children's further life expectancies examined at age 35 to age 65. This pattern is more pronounced for younger cohorts. In most cases, the education of the father is not significantly related to children's life expectancy. Neither the vocational training nor the occupational position of the parents in childhood, which both correlate with household income, can explain the connection. The health behaviour of the children and the health accumulated over the life course appear as important channels. This study extends the previous literature that focused mostly on the relationship between individuals' own education and their life expectancy. It implies that the link between education and life expectancy is substantially stronger and that returns to education are higher if the intergenerational component is considered.",Parental education can impact children's life expectancy.,How does parental education influence children's life expectancy?,Analysis of German Socio-Economic Panel Study data to assess the association between parental education and children's life expectancy.,"Maternal education is related to children's life expectancy, with lower maternal education associated with lower life expectancy for children.","Focused on German data, potential unmeasured confounders, limited to specific age groups."

We conducted a prospective cohort study across 23 Japanese municipalities between 2010 and 2013. Functionally independent community-dwelling older adults aged ≥65 years (n = 65 952) in 2010 were eligible for the study. The baseline survey was conducted from 2010 to 2012, and the self-reporting questionnaires were mailed to 126 438 community-dwelling older adults [64.8% (81 980/126 438) response rate]. The follow-up survey was conducted in 2013. Overall, 65 952 individuals were followed up [80.4% (65 952/81 980) follow-up rate]. The health status was classified into five groups: robust; pre-frailty; frailty; disability and death. We conducted three multinomial logistic regression models stratified by the initial disability status. Educational attainment and equivalized household income were separately added to the models as exposures after adjusting for covariates.
Participants with the lowest educational level were less likely to recover from pre-frailty to robust compared with those with the highest level [odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval (CI)) = 0.84 (0.76-0.93)]. The participants with the lowest income level were also less likely to recover from pre-frailty to robust compared with those with the highest level [OR (95% CI) = 0.80 (0.69-0.91)].

In this study, we used the SEER (Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results) database to identify prognostic factors with the BCBMs.
We identified and built a robust prognostic model and developed reliable nomograms to estimate the individualized overall survival (OS) and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) of patients with BCBM. A total of 789 patients with newly diagnosed BCBM were identified from the SEER database and randomly divided into training (n = 554) and testing (n = 235) cohorts. The log-rank tests and the Cox proportional hazards model were applied to evaluate the prognostic effects of multiple clinicopathologic variables on the survival of training cohorts. Significant prognostic factors were combined to build the nomograms that were evaluated using the concordance index and calibration plots for internal and external validations.
Two nomograms shared the common prognostic indicators including age, tumor subtype, chemotherapy, surgery, number of metastatic sites except the brain, and median household income. In the training cohort, the Harrell concordance index for the constructed nomogram to predict OS and BCSS was 0.668 and 0.676, respectively. The calibration plots were consistent between nomogram-predicted survival probability and actual survival probability. These results were reproducible when nomograms were applied to the testing cohort for external validation.

However, it is unclear whether the associations between cardiovascular disease and common measures of socioeconomic status-wealth and education-differ among high-income, middle-income, and low-income countries, and, if so, why these differences exist. We explored the association between education and household wealth and cardiovascular disease and mortality to assess which marker is the stronger predictor of outcomes, and examined whether any differences in cardiovascular disease by socioeconomic status parallel differences in risk factor levels or differences in management.
In this large-scale prospective cohort study, we recruited adults aged between 35 years and 70 years from 367 urban and 302 rural communities in 20 countries. We collected data on families and households in two questionnaires, and data on cardiovascular risk factors in a third questionnaire, which was supplemented with physical examination. We assessed socioeconomic status using education and a household wealth index. Education was categorised as no or primary school education only, secondary school education, or higher education, defined as completion of trade school, college, or university. Household wealth, calculated at the household level and with household data, was defined by an index on the basis of ownership of assets and housing characteristics. Primary outcomes were major cardiovascular disease (a composite of cardiovascular deaths, strokes, myocardial infarction, and heart failure), cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality. Information on specific events was obtained from participants or their family.
Recruitment to the study began on Jan 12, 2001, with most participants enrolled between Jan 6, 2005, and Dec 4, 2014. 160 299 (87·9%) of 182 375 participants with baseline data had available follow-up event data and were eligible for inclusion. After exclusion of 6130 (3·8%) participants without complete baseline or follow-up data, 154 169 individuals remained for analysis, from five low-income, 11 middle-income, and four high-income countries. Participants were followed-up for a mean of 7·5 years. Major cardiovascular events were more common among those with low levels of education in all types of country studied, but much more so in low-income countries. After adjustment for wealth and other factors, the HR (low level of education vs high level of education) was 1·23 (95% CI 0·96-1·58) for high-income countries, 1·59 (1·42-1·78) in middle-income countries, and 2·23 (1·79-2·77) in low-income countries (p
Although people with a lower level of education in low-income and middle-income countries have higher incidence of and mortality from cardiovascular disease, they have better overall risk factor profiles. However, these individuals have markedly poorer health care. Policies to reduce health inequities globally must include strategies to overcome barriers to care, especially for those with lower levels of education.

Retrospective cohort study.
Using the United States Renal Data System database, we identified 56,194 nursing home residents initiated on maintenance dialysis from January 1, 2007 through December 31, 2013, followed until May 31, 2014.
We evaluated baseline characteristics of the NH cohort on dialysis, including race and ethnicity. We assessed the Medicare-Medicaid dual eligibility status as an indicator of individual-level poverty and ZIP code-level median household income (MHI) data. We conducted Cox regression analyses with all-cause mortality as the outcome variable, adjusted for clinical and sociodemographic factors including end-of-life preferences.
Adjusted Cox analysis showed a significantly lower risk of death among black vs nonblack NH residents [adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) 0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89, 0.94]. Dual-eligibility status was significantly associated with lower risk of death compared to those with Medicare alone (AHR 0.80, 95% CI 0.78, 0.82).

Care cost at the end of life was defined as the sum of the national health insurance contributions and statutory self-contributions. To measure proximity to death, deceased elderly were divided by the period from last hospital visit to death (except any hospital visit at time of death).

The slope of socioeconomic inequality of the probability of dying within five years after the diagnosis of ALL was estimated.
For the 294 patients studied, the 5 years survival rate was 53.7%; the median survival was 4.06 years (4.9 years for standard-risk diagnosis; 2.5 years for high-risk diagnosis). The attrition rate was 12%. The Cox model showed that children who had been IMSS-insured for less than half their lives had more than double the risk of dying than those who had been insured for their entire lives.
We did not find evidence of socioeconomic inequalities in the survival of children with ALL associated with family income, educational and occupational level of parents. However, we found a relevant gradient related social security protection: the longer children's life insured by social security, the higher their probability of surviving ALL was. These results add evidence of the effectiveness of social security, as a mechanism of wealth redistribution and a promoter of social mobility. Extending these social security benefits to the entire Mexican population could promote better health outcomes.",Socioeconomic inequalities impact survival in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).,How do socioeconomic factors influence survival in children with ALL enrolled in the IMSS in Mexico?,"Analysis of 5-year survival data in children diagnosed with ALL, adjusting for socioeconomic and clinical characteristics.","Children insured for longer periods had higher survival rates, indicating the importance of social security in improving outcomes.","Potential for unmeasured confounders, limited generalizability."

Differences in rates of diffuse disease, autoantibody status, or socioeconomic status have not completely explained this phenomenon. Our study evaluates these risks at our site.
A retrospective study comparing African American and non-African American patients with scleroderma seen from 2008 to 2016 was performed. Groups were matched by sex, age at first visit, date of first visit, disease duration at first visit, and limited versus diffuse cutaneous disease. Demographic, serologic, and clinical features were compared. Mortality risks were assessed by a Cox proportional hazards model with covariates of race, marital status, education, employment, insurance, and imputed household income.
African Americans comprised 202 of 402 patients. They demonstrated reduced forced vital capacity and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide, more severe lung fibrosis, a higher prevalence of pulmonary hypertension, and more severe cardiac involvement. The autoantibody profile statistically differed between the 2 groups. Death during follow-up was 21% in African Americans versus 11% in non-African Americans (P = 0.005). African American race demonstrated an unadjusted hazard ratio for death during follow-up of 2.061 (P = 0.006) that declined with adjustment for socioeconomic covariates to 1.256 (P = 0.633). The only significant covariate was median income in tens of thousands of dollars by zip code (hazard ratio 0.845; P = 0.033).
African American patients with scleroderma have more severe pulmonary disease and higher unadjusted mortality than matched non-African Americans. Following adjustment for socioeconomic factors, African American race was not a significant risk factor for mortality; however, independent of race, a lower median household income predicted increased mortality.",African Americans with scleroderma have higher mortality rates and more severe disease.,What factors contribute to the disparities in disease severity and mortality among African American scleroderma patients?,"Retrospective study comparing African American and non-African American scleroderma patients, adjusting for socioeconomic factors.","African American patients had more severe disease and higher mortality, which was partly explained by lower household income.","Potential for selection bias, lack of detailed clinical data."

We hypothesized that patients admitted to hospital on weekends who have surgery have an increased risk of death compared with patients who are admitted and have surgery on weekdays.
This matched cohort study included 318,202 adult patients from Ontario health administrative and demographic databases, admitted to acute care hospitals from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2015. A total of 159,101 patients who were admitted on weekends and underwent noncardiac surgery were classified by day of surgery (weekend versus weekday) and matched 1:1 to patients who both were admitted and had surgery on a weekday (Tuesday to Thursday); matching was based on age (in years), anesthesia basic unit value for the surgical procedure, median neighborhood household income quintile, resource utilization band (a ranking system of overall morbidity), rurality of home location, year of admission, and urgency of admission. Of weekend admissions, 16.2% (25,872) were elective and 53.9% (85,744) had surgery on the weekend of admission. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality within 30 days of the date of hospital admission. The 30-day all-cause mortality for patients admitted on weekends who had noncardiac surgery was 2.6% (4,211/159,101) versus 2.5% (3,901/159,101) for those who were admitted and had surgery on weekdays (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.05; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.11; P = 0.03). However, there was significant heterogeneity in the increased odds of death according to the urgency of admission and when surgery was performed (weekend versus weekday). For urgent admissions on weekends (n = 133,229), there was no significant increase in odds of mortality when surgery was performed on the weekend (adjusted OR 1.02; 95% CI 0.95 to 1.09; P = 0.7) or on a subsequent weekday (adjusted OR 1.05; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.12; P = 0.2) compared to urgent admissions on weekdays. Elective admissions on weekends (n = 25,782) had increased risk of death both when surgery was performed on the weekend (adjusted OR 3.30; 95% CI 1.98 to 5.49; P < 0.001) and when surgery was performed on a subsequent weekday (adjusted OR 2.70; 95% CI 1.81 to 4.03; P < 0.001). The main limitations of this study were the lack of data regarding reason for admission and cause of increased time interval from admission to surgery for some cases, the small number of deaths in some subgroups (i.e., elective surgery), and the possibility of residual unmeasured confounding from increased illness severity for weekend admissions.
When patients have surgery during their hospitalization, admission on weekends in Ontario, Canada, was associated with a small but significant proportional increase in 30-day all-cause mortality, but there was significant heterogeneity in outcomes depending on the urgency of admission and when surgery was performed. An increased risk of death was found only for elective admissions on weekends; whether this is a function of patient-level factors or represents a true weekend effect needs to be further elucidated. These findings have potential implications for resource allocation in hospitals and the redistribution of elective surgery to weekends.","Weekend hospital admissions have been associated with increased mortality, but findings are inconsistent.",Is there an increased risk of death for patients admitted on weekends and undergoing surgery compared to those admitted and operated on weekdays?,Matched cohort study using Ontario health administrative and demographic databases to assess 30-day mortality outcomes.,"Weekend admissions with surgery had a small but significant increase in 30-day mortality, with heterogeneity based on urgency of admission and timing of surgery.","Lack of detailed clinical data, potential for residual confounding."

However, there is little evidence from large-scale studies on the prevalence and management of hypertension in Cuba, and no direct evidence of the expected benefit of such efforts on cardiovascular mortality.
In a prospective cohort study, adults in the general population identified via local family medical practices were interviewed between Jan 1, 1996, and Nov 24, 2002, in five areas of Cuba, and a subset of participants were resurveyed between July 14, 2006, and Oct 19, 2008, in one area. During household visits, blood pressure was measured and information obtained on diagnosis and treatment of hypertension. We calculated the prevalence of hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mm Hg, or receiving treatment for hypertension) and the proportion of people with hypertension in whom it was diagnosed, treated, and controlled (systolic blood pressure <140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg). Deaths were identified through linkage by national identification numbers to the Cuban Public Health Ministry records, to Dec 31, 2016. We used Cox regression analysis to compare cardiovascular mortality between participants with versus without uncontrolled hypertension. Rate ratios (RRs) were used to estimate the fraction of cardiovascular deaths attributable to hypertension.
146 556 participants were interviewed in the baseline survey in 1996-2002 and 24 345 were interviewed in the resurvey in 2006-08. After exclusion for incomplete data and age outside the range of interest, 136 111 respondents aged 35-79 years (mean age 54 [SD 12] years; 75 947 [56%] women, 60 164 [44%] men) were eligible for inclusion in the analyses. 34% of participants had hypertension. Among these, 67% had a diagnosis of hypertension. 76% of participants with diagnosed hypertension were receiving treatment and blood pressure was controlled in 36% of those people. During 1·7 million person-years of follow-up there were 5707 cardiovascular deaths. In the age groups 35-59, 60-69, and 70-79 years, uncontrolled hypertension at baseline was associated with RRs of 2·15 (95% CI 1·88-2·46), 1·86 (1·69-2·05), and 1·41 (1·32-1·52), respectively, and accounted for around 20% of premature cardiovascular deaths.
In this Cuban population, a third of people had hypertension. Although levels of hypertension diagnosis and treatment were commensurate with those in some high-income countries, the proportion of participants whose blood pressure was controlled was low. As well as reducing hypertension prevalence, improvement in blood pressure control among people with diagnosed hypertension is required to prevent premature cardiovascular deaths in Cuba.

We conducted a nationwide population-based study using a National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort of the Korean population, consisting of 1 million individuals who submitted medical care claims between 2002 and 2013. RA was identified using as the International Classification of Diseases code M05 (seropositive RA), with prescription of any disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD). Our analysis was based on the data of 1655 patients with incident seropositive RA and 8275 non-RA controls. The controls were matched to the RA cohort by sex, age at the time of diagnosis, duration of follow-up, geographic region, type of social security, and household income.
The most commonly used conventional synthetic DMARDs were hydroxychloroquine (71.30%) and methotrexate (69.5%), with adalimumab being the most commonly used biologic DMARD (2.54%). The mortality rate was significantly higher in the RA than the control group (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 1.29, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.64) in the first 10 years after diagnosis. Specifically, mortality due to infectious diseases (IRR 4.41, 95% CI 1.60-12.17) and pneumonia (IRR 3.92, 95% CI 1.46-10.53) was significantly higher in the RA than control group. The disability rate was higher in the RA than control group over the first 10 years of the disease (IRR 2.27, 95% CI 1.77-2.92), which was attributed to a higher incidence of physical disability (IRR 3.81, 95% CI 2.81-5.15). Annual health expenditure was greater for the RA than the control group.
Therefore, the rate of mortality and disability, as well as healthcare expenditure, are higher for patients with RA over the first 10 years of the disease onset, than the general population of Korea. The use of claim data has limited the quality of information and there is a limit to the observation period, and we expect the prospective national-wide multicenter cohort for longer period to overcome these limitations.",Survivors of paediatric astrocytoma are at risk for late mortality and morbidity.,What are the long-term outcomes in ageing paediatric astrocytoma survivors?,"Longitudinal evaluation of astrocytoma survivors and siblings to assess late mortality, chronic conditions, and social outcomes.","Survivors had increased risk of chronic conditions, poor health status, and social impairment compared to siblings, necessitating lifelong monitoring.","Reliance on retrospective data, potential for selection bias."

We aimed to determine racial and socioeconomic disparities in the surgical management and outcomes of patients with CRC in a contemporary, national cohort.
We performed a retrospective analysis of the National Inpatient Sample for the period 2009-2015. Adult patients diagnosed with CRC and who underwent colorectal resection were included. Multivariable linear and logistic regressions were used to assess the effect of race, insurance type, and household income on patient outcomes.
A total of 100,515 patients were included: 72,552 (72%) had elective admissions and 27,963 (28%) underwent laparoscopic surgery. Patients with private insurance and higher household income were consistently more likely to have laparoscopic procedures, compared to other insurance types and income levels, p < 0.0001. Black patients, compared to white patients, were more likely to have postoperative complications (OR 1.23, 95% CI, 1.17, 1.29). Patients with Medicare and Medicaid, compared to private insurance, were also more likely to have postoperative complications (OR 1.30, 95% CI, 1.24, 1.37 and OR 1.40, 95% CI, 1.31, 1.50). Patients in low-household-income areas had higher rates of any complication (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.06, 1.16).
The use of laparoscopic surgery in patients with CRC is strongly influenced by insurance type and household income, with Medicare, Medicaid and low-income patients being less likely to undergo laparoscopic surgery. In addition, black patients, patients with public insurance, and patients with low household income have significant worse surgical outcomes.","Influenza vaccination is important for patients with heart failure, but its impact on outcomes is unclear.",Is influenza vaccination associated with improved long-term survival in patients with heart failure?,Nationwide cohort study in Denmark assessing vaccination status and mortality outcomes in heart failure patients.,"Influenza vaccination was associated with reduced risk of all-cause and cardiovascular death, with greater benefits seen with frequent and early vaccination.","Potential for unmeasured confounders, observational study design."

This study aimed to describe mortality before and after retirement in the Japanese middle-aged/elderly with special attention to socioeconomic position and social relationships.
We conducted a 10-year follow-up study (the Komo-Ise cohort study) and assessed mortality according to socioeconomic positions (relative poverty and occupation) and social relationships (e.g., marital status, living alone, and social support) in workers and the retired. Relative poverty was defined as a household equivalent income of 12,700 US dollars (1.37 million Japanese Yen) or less in 2000. Stratified analyses were conducted according to sex in two groups of employment status: the workers and the retired. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using the Cox proportional hazard model.
We included 5534 individuals. Of these, 3360 were men (working, 2499; retired, 861) and 2174 were women (working, 1306; retired, 868). We observed 610 deaths (475 in men and 135 in women) during the study period. Relative poverty was a significant risk factor for death (HR 1.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07-2.14) among retired men but not among working men (HR 1.20, 95% CI 0.79-1.83). Among workers, self-employed men showed a significantly higher hazard of death (HR 1.57, 95% CI 1.09-2.25) than white-collar employees. Retired men who lacked participation in social activities were more likely to die than those who did not (HR 1.44, 95% CI 1.06-1.94).

Mean age at baseline was 61 years, and the sample was 54% female, 27% white, 30% African-American, and 43% Hispanic. At baseline, 58% of the sample was married; 32% had household income below $25,000 per year, 35% had income between $25,000 and $49,999 per year, and 34% had income above $50,000 per year; 41% had a high school education or less, 30% had some college, and 29% had a college degree or more. Relative telomere length (T/S ratio) was measured by the quantitative polymerase chain reaction method. In general, ten-year telomere attrition was greater for groups that had longer telomere length at baseline, including younger people, whites, and women. After adjusting for baseline telomere length, race/ethnic differences in telomere attrition were attenuated, and age and sex differences were reversed, such that older people and men showed greater telomere shortening. There were no significant differences in telomere attrition by marital status, income, or education.

We longitudinally evaluated 1182 5-year astrocytoma survivors diagnosed between 1970 and 1986 and 4023 siblings enrolled in a retrospective cohort study. Kaplan-Meier estimates of late mortality and cumulative incidence of serious chronic conditions were estimated. Cox regression models provided hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for development of chronic conditions, and generalised linear models provided relative risks (RRs) of the poor health status and social outcomes.
At 30 years from diagnosis, cumulative late mortality was 22.1% (CI 20.0-24.3%), primarily due to disease progression or recurrence. Compared with siblings, survivors were at increased risk of serious chronic conditions (HR 4.6, CI 3.8-5.5). Survivors reported higher rates of poor general health (RR 3.3, CI 2.8-3.8), poor mental health (RR 1.9, CI 1.7-2.1), functional impairment (RR 9.0, CI 7.7-10.5) and activity limitation (RR 3.6, CI 3.1-4.2) and lower rates of college graduation (RR 0.75, CI 0.69-0.82), marriage (RR 0.62, CI 0.58-0.66), employment (RR 0.75, CI 0.72-0.79) and household income ≥$40,000 (RR 0.68, CI 0.64-0.73). Even survivors without radiation exposure had elevated risk of chronic conditions, poor health status and social impairment compared with siblings.

The objective of this study was to identify patterns of aged care use among older Australian women and to examine how these patterns were associated with their demographic and health-related characteristics.
The sample consisted of 8768 women from the 1921-1926 birth cohort of the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health (ALSWH), who had survived to age 75-80 years. ALSWH survey and linked administrative aged care and death datasets from 2001 to 2011 were utilized. Patterns of aged care use were identified using a repeated measure latent class analysis.
We identified four patterns of aged care use over time, differentiated by timing of service onset, types of service use and time of death. Approximately 41% of the sample were non-users or using basic home and community care (HACC), while 24% were at high risk of using moderate to high-level HACC/community aged care package (CACP). Only 11% had a greater risk of using residential aged care (RAC) over time. Being widowed, residing in remote/regional areas, having difficulty in managing income, having a chronic condition, reporting poor/fair self-rated health, and lower SF-36 quality of life scores were associated with an increased odds of being a member of the following classes: 1) moderate to high-level HACC/CACP, 2) increasing RAC, and 3) early mortality, compared with the non-user class.

Past work on forecasting has provided an incomplete landscape of future health scenarios, highlighting a need for a more robust modelling platform from which policy options and potential health trajectories can be assessed. This study provides a novel approach to modelling life expectancy, all-cause mortality and cause of death forecasts -and alternative future scenarios-for 250 causes of death from 2016 to 2040 in 195 countries and territories.
We modelled 250 causes and cause groups organised by the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) hierarchical cause structure, using GBD 2016 estimates from 1990-2016, to generate predictions for 2017-40. Our modelling framework used data from the GBD 2016 study to systematically account for the relationships between risk factors and health outcomes for 79 independent drivers of health. We developed a three-component model of cause-specific mortality: a component due to changes in risk factors and select interventions; the underlying mortality rate for each cause that is a function of income per capita, educational attainment, and total fertility rate under 25 years and time; and an autoregressive integrated moving average model for unexplained changes correlated with time. We assessed the performance by fitting models with data from 1990-2006 and using these to forecast for 2007-16. Our final model used for generating forecasts and alternative scenarios was fitted to data from 1990-2016. We used this model for 195 countries and territories to generate a reference scenario or forecast through 2040 for each measure by location. Additionally, we generated better health and worse health scenarios based on the 85th and 15th percentiles, respectively, of annualised rates of change across location-years for all the GBD risk factors, income per person, educational attainment, select intervention coverage, and total fertility rate under 25 years in the past. We used the model to generate all-cause age-sex specific mortality, life expectancy, and years of life lost (YLLs) for 250 causes. Scenarios for fertility were also generated and used in a cohort component model to generate population scenarios. For each reference forecast, better health, and worse health scenarios, we generated estimates of mortality and YLLs attributable to each risk factor in the future.
Globally, most independent drivers of health were forecast to improve by 2040, but 36 were forecast to worsen. As shown by the better health scenarios, greater progress might be possible, yet for some drivers such as high body-mass index (BMI), their toll will rise in the absence of intervention. We forecasted global life expectancy to increase by 4·4 years (95% UI 2·2 to 6·4) for men and 4·4 years (2·1 to 6·4) for women by 2040, but based on better and worse health scenarios, trajectories could range from a gain of 7·8 years (5·9 to 9·8) to a non-significant loss of 0·4 years (-2·8 to 2·2) for men, and an increase of 7·2 years (5·3 to 9·1) to essentially no change (0·1 years [-2·7 to 2·5]) for women. In 2040, Japan, Singapore, Spain, and Switzerland had a forecasted life expectancy exceeding 85 years for both sexes, and 59 countries including China were projected to surpass a life expectancy of 80 years by 2040. At the same time, Central African Republic, Lesotho, Somalia, and Zimbabwe had projected life expectancies below 65 years in 2040, indicating global disparities in survival are likely to persist if current trends hold. Forecasted YLLs showed a rising toll from several non-communicable diseases (NCDs), partly driven by population growth and ageing. Differences between the reference forecast and alternative scenarios were most striking for HIV/AIDS, for which a potential increase of 120·2% (95% UI 67·2-190·3) in YLLs (nearly 118 million) was projected globally from 2016-40 under the worse health scenario. Compared with 2016, NCDs were forecast to account for a greater proportion of YLLs in all GBD regions by 2040 (67·3% of YLLs [95% UI 61·9-72·3] globally); nonetheless, in many lower-income countries, communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) diseases still accounted for a large share of YLLs in 2040 (eg, 53·5% of YLLs [95% UI 48·3-58·5] in Sub-Saharan Africa). There were large gaps for many health risks between the reference forecast and better health scenario for attributable YLLs. In most countries, metabolic risks amenable to health care (eg, high blood pressure and high plasma fasting glucose) and risks best targeted by population-level or intersectoral interventions (eg, tobacco, high BMI, and ambient particulate matter pollution) had some of the largest differences between reference and better health scenarios. The main exception was sub-Saharan Africa, where many risks associated with poverty and lower levels of development (eg, unsafe water and sanitation, household air pollution, and child malnutrition) were projected to still account for substantive disparities between reference and better health scenarios in 2040.
With the present study, we provide a robust, flexible forecasting platform from which reference forecasts and alternative health scenarios can be explored in relation to a wide range of independent drivers of health. Our reference forecast points to overall improvements through 2040 in most countries, yet the range found across better and worse health scenarios renders a precarious vision of the future-a world with accelerating progress from technical innovation but with the potential for worsening health outcomes in the absence of deliberate policy action. For some causes of YLLs, large differences between the reference forecast and alternative scenarios reflect the opportunity to accelerate gains if countries move their trajectories toward better health scenarios-or alarming challenges if countries fall behind their reference forecasts. Generally, decision makers should plan for the likely continued shift toward NCDs and target resources toward the modifiable risks that drive substantial premature mortality. If such modifiable risks are prioritised today, there is opportunity to reduce avoidable mortality in the future. However, CMNN causes and related risks will remain the predominant health priority among lower-income countries. Based on our 2040 worse health scenario, there is a real risk of HIV mortality rebounding if countries lose momentum against the HIV epidemic, jeopardising decades of progress against the disease. Continued technical innovation and increased health spending, including development assistance for health targeted to the world's poorest people, are likely to remain vital components to charting a future where all populations can live full, healthy lives.

We aimed to examine the association between family socioeconomic status and postoperative outcomes for paediatric patients with complex congenital heart disease (CCHD).
In this observational cohort study, we enrolled children (aged <7 years) who had CCHD surgery at Fuwai Hospital (Beijing, China) between May 1, 2012, and Dec 31, 2015. Patients who were discharged alive were followed up for up to 60 months, until May 4, 2017, for all-cause mortality and unplanned readmission events. Baseline family socioeconomic status was established using a composite of household income in the past year, and occupation and education level of each parent in the family. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to evaluate the relationship between socioeconomic status and prognosis.
Of 2555 patients (median age at operation 0·88 years, IQR 0·56-1·92) enrolled, 2485 (97%) were discharged alive and were assessed at a median follow-up of 32·1 months (IQR 19·6-44·7). During follow-up, 180 (7%) patients died, and 748 (30%) patients had 1477 unplanned readmissions. Children with low family socioeconomic status (n=899) had higher unadjusted all-cause mortality and more unplanned readmission events than children with middle (n=819) or high (n=767) family socioeconomic status; 3-year overall survival was 88·5% (95% CI 86·3-90·7), 93·1% (91·1-95·1), and 96·3% (94·7-97·9), and 3-year unplanned-readmission-free survival was 56·3% (52·8-59·8), 68·4% (64·9-71·9), and 82·4% (79·5-85·3) across the socioeconomic tertiles (both log-rank p<0·001). After adjustment for demographic factors, weight, cardiac diagnostic categories, operation types, and characteristics of the index hospital stay, hazard ratios were 2·66 (1·62-4·35) for all-cause mortality and 4·17 (3·31-5·25) for unplanned readmission for low versus high family socioeconomic status, and 1·95 (1·18-3·22) and 2·44 (1·94-3·07), respectively, for middle versus high family socioeconomic status.

We investigated determinants and consequences of financial hardship among adult survivors of childhood cancer.
Financial hardship, determinants, and consequences were examined in 2811 long-term survivors (mean age at evaluation = 31.8 years, years postdiagnosis = 23.6) through the baseline survey and clinical evaluation. Financial hardship was measured by material, psychological, and coping/behavioral domains. Outcomes included health and life insurance affordability, retirement planning, symptoms, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Odds ratios (ORs) estimated associations of determinants with financial hardship. Odds ratios and regression coefficients estimated associations of hardship with symptom prevalence and HRQOL, respectively. All statistical tests were two-sided.
Among participants, 22.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 20.8% to 24.0%), 51.1% (95% CI = 49.2% to 52.9%), and 33.0% (95% CI = 31.1% to 34.6%) reported material, psychological, and coping/behavioral hardship, respectively. Risk factors across hardship domains included annual household income of $39 999 or less vs $80 000 or more (material OR = 3.04, 95% CI = 2.08 to 4.46, psychological OR = 3.64, 95% CI = 2.76 to 4.80, and coping/behavioral OR = 4.95, 95% CI = 3.57 to 6.86) and below high school attainment vs college graduate or above (material OR = 2.22, 95% CI = 1.45 to 3.42, psychological OR = 1.75, 95% CI = 1.18 to 2.62, and coping/behavioral OR = 2.05, 95% CI = 1.38 to 3.06). Myocardial infarction, peripheral neuropathy, subsequent neoplasm, seizure, stroke, reproductive disorders, amputation, and upper gastrointestinal disease were associated with higher material hardship (all P < .05). Hardship across three domains was associated with somatization, anxiety and depression (all P < .001), suicidal ideation (all P < .05), and difficulty in retirement planning (all P < .001).

This study used the cohort of the National Health Insurance Corporation, which provides medical care to all residents of the Republic of Korea. The cohort consists of patients aged 20 years or older between 2003 and 2010 with a history of ICU admission. We analyzed changes in sex, age, household income, number of hospital beds, emergency admissions, and reasons for admission using the Cochran-Armitage trend test. The adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of mortality according to these variables and year of admission were calculated by Cox proportional hazards regression.
The proportion of patients aged ≥70 years increased over that period, as did their average age (by 3.6 years). During the 8-year study period, the 3-year mortality rate was 32.91%-35.83%. The overall mortality was higher in males and older patients, in those with a lower household income and higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score, those admitted to a hospital with a smaller number of beds, and those admitted via the emergency room. There was no significant change in crude mortality rate over the 8-year study period; however, the adjusted HR showed a decreasing trend.

Globally, many low- and middle-income countries have introduced rotavirus vaccine, resulting in documented reductions in hospitalizations and child mortality. We examined the potential impact and cost-effectiveness of introducing rotavirus vaccination in Lao People's Democratic Republic using an Excel-based spreadsheet model. We estimated mortality risk factors, patterns of care seeking, and vaccination access to predict outcomes for regional, provincial, and socioeconomic subpopulations for one birth cohort through their first five years of life and life course in Disability-Adjusted Life Years estimates. Socioeconomic status was defined by categorizing households into regional wealth quintiles based on a national asset index. We modeled a two-dose ROTARIX vaccine under current Gavi pricing and efficacy estimates from Bangladesh and Vietnam. DPT1 and DPT2 coverages were used to estimate rotavirus vaccination coverage. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was used to assess the impact of uncertainty on model parameters on predicted incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), including scenarios of increases in vaccination coverage. Rotavirus vaccination would prevent 143 child deaths/year, or 28% of annual rotavirus burden. The estimated national level ICER for rotavirus vaccination was $140/DALY, with regional socioeconomic subpopulation estimates ranging from $72/DALY for the poorest in the Central region to $353/DALY for the richest in the North region, indicating high cost-effectiveness. Within regions, ICERs are most favorable for children in the poorer and poorest quintiles.

This study aims i) to determine the quantity and quality of multimorbidity patterns among refugees and family reunification immigrants from non-Western countries compared to Danish-born, and ii) to compare the mortality burden among those with multimorbidity in the two groups.
Through the Danish Immigration Service, we conducted a historically prospective cohort study. We identified a total of 101,894 adult migrants who were sub-categorised into refugees and family reunification immigrants, and matched them to a Danish-born comparison group 1:6 on age and sex. Through the Danish National Patient Registry, we obtained information on all in- and outpatient data on hospitalised and ambulatory patients. To assess multimorbidity we used Charlson Comorbidity Index based on ICD-10 codes, together with ICD-10 diagnostic categories for psychiatric disease. We used Cox regression analysis to calculate risk of multimorbidity and risk of mortality in people with multimorbidity.
Overall refugees had higher risk of multimorbidity compared to Danish-born, while family reunification immigrants had a lower risk. When adjusting for civil status and mean income, the risk was lower for all migrant groups compared to Danish-born.

Logistic regression models were utilized to determine the association of individual-level predictors, neighborhood deprivation, and residence in hotspot regions on the odds of being within guidelines for CRC screening.
Lower household income, lack of health insurance, and being a smoker were each associated with lower odds of being within guidelines for CRC screening in both cohorts. Area-level associations were less evident, although up to 15% lower guideline adherence was associated with residence in neighborhoods of greater deprivation and in the Lower Mississippi Delta, one of the identified CRC mortality hotspots.

We investigated the relations between BMI, systolic blood pressure, and mortality in India.
Men and women aged 35 years or older were recruited into a prospective study from the general population in Chennai, India between Jan 1, 1998, and Dec 31, 2001. Participants were interviewed (data collected included age, sex, education, socioeconomic status, medical history, tobacco smoking, and alcohol intake) and measured (height, weight, and blood pressure). Deaths were identified by linkage to Chennai city mortality records and through active surveillance by household visits from trained graduate non-medical fieldworkers. After the baseline survey, households were visited once in 2002-05, then biennially until 2015. During these repeat visits, structured narratives of any deaths that took place before March 31, 2015, were recorded for physician coding. During 2013-14, a random sample of participants was also resurveyed as per baseline to assess long-term variability in systolic blood pressure and BMI. Cox regression (standardised for tobacco, alcohol, and social factors) was used to relate mortality rate ratios (RRs) at ages 35-69 years to systolic blood pressure, BMI, or BMI adjusted for usual systolic blood pressure.
500 810 participants were recruited. After exclusion of those with chronic disease or incomplete data, 414 746 participants aged 35-69 years (mean 46 [SD 9]; 45% women) remained. At recruitment, mean systolic blood pressure was 127 mm Hg (SD 15), and mean BMI was 23·2 kg/m
In this South Asian population, BMI was little associated with vascular mortality, even though increased BMI is associated with increased systolic blood pressure, which in turn is associated with increased vascular mortality. Hence, some close correlates of below-average BMI must have important adverse effects, which could be of relevance in all populations.

Research suggests that societal factors such as structural racism explain more variation in adverse birth outcomes than individual-level factors and societal poverty alone. The Index of Concentration at the Extremes (ICE) measures spatial social polarization by quantifying extremes of deprived and privileged social groups using a single metric and has been shown to partially explain racial disparities in black carbon exposures, mortality, fatal and non-fatal assaults, and adverse birth outcomes such as preterm birth and infant mortality. The objective of this analysis was to assess if local measures of racial and economic segregation as proxies for structural racism are associated and preterm birth and infant mortality experienced by Black women residing in California. California birth cohort files were merged with the American Community Survey by zip code (2011-2012). The ICE was used to quantify privileged and deprived groups (i.e., Black vs. White; high income vs. low income; Black low income vs. White high income) by zip code. ICE scores range from - 1 (deprived) to 1 (privileged). ICE scores were categorized into five quintiles based on sample distributions of these measures: quintile 1 (least privileged)-quintile 5 (most privileged). Generalized linear mixed models were used to test the likelihood that ICE measures were associated with preterm birth or with infant mortality experienced by Black women residing in California. Black women were most likely to reside in zip codes with greater extreme income concentrations, and moderate extreme race and race + income concentrations. Bivariate analysis revealed that greater extreme income, race, and race + income concentrations increased the odds of preterm birth and infant mortality. For example, women residing in least privileged zip codes (quintile 1) were significantly more likely to experience preterm birth (race + income ICE OR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.72-1.46) and infant mortality (race + income ICE OR = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.17-2.47) compared to women living in the most privileged zip codes (quintile 5). Adjusting for maternal characteristics, income, race, and race + income concentrations remained negatively associated with preterm birth. However, only race and race + income concentrations remained associated with infant mortality. Findings support that ICE is a promising measure of structural racism that can be used to address racial disparities in preterm birth and infant mortality experienced by Black women in California.",SES impacts health outcomes.,How does public rental housing relate to mortality in Singapore?,Retrospective cohort study in Singapore analyzing public rental housing and mortality risk.,Residence in public rental housing associated with increased mortality risk.

We therefore undertook a national study in Canada to examine associations between urban greenness and cause-specific mortality.
We used data from a large cohort study (the 2001 Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohort [2001 CanCHEC]), which consisted of approximately 1·3 million adult (aged ≥19 years), non-immigrant, urban Canadians in 30 cities who responded to the mandatory 2001 Statistics Canada long-form census. The cohort has been linked by Statistics Canada to the Canadian mortality database and to annual income tax filings through 2011. We measured greenness with images from the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer from NASA's Aqua satellite. We assigned estimates of exposure to greenness derived from remotely sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) within both 250 m and 500 m of participants' residences for each year during 11 years of follow-up (between 2001 and 2011). We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate associations between residential greenness (as a continuous variable) and mortality. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% CIs per IQR (0·15) increase in NDVI adjusted for personal (eg, education and income) and contextual covariates, including exposures to fine particulate matter, ozone, and nitrogen dioxide. We also considered effect modification by selected personal covariates (age, sex, household income adequacy quintiles, highest level of education, and marital status).
Our cohort consisted of approximately 1 265 000 individuals at baseline who contributed 11 523 770 person-years. We showed significant decreased risks of mortality in the range of 8-12% from all causes of death examined with increased greenness around participants' residence. In the fully adjusted analyses, the risk was significantly decreased for all causes of death (non-accidental HR 0·915, 95% CI 0·905-0·924; cardiovascular plus diabetes 0·911, 0·895-0·928; cardiovascular 0·911, 0·894-0·928; ischaemic heart disease 0·904, 0·882-0·927; cerebrovascular 0·942, 0·902-0·983; and respiratory 0·899, 0·869-0·930). Greenness associations were more protective among men than women (HR 0·880, 95% CI 0·868-0·893 vs 0·955, 0·941-0·969), and among individuals with higher incomes (highest quintile 0·812, 0·791-0·834 vs lowest quintile 0·991, 0·972-1·011) and more education (degree or more 0·816, 0·791-0·842 vs did not complete high school 0·964, 0·950-0·978).
Increased amounts of residential greenness were associated with reduced risks of dying from several common causes of death among urban Canadians. We identified evidence of inequalities, both in terms of exposures to greenness and mortality risks, by personal socioeconomic status among individuals living in generally similar environments, and with reasonably similar access to health care and other social services. The findings support the development of policies related to creating greener and healthier cities.

Ten levels of household income were used as indicators of economic status. Diabetes was defined as elevated fasting blood glucose (≥ 6.9 mmol/l) and/or use of glucose-lowering drugs or insulin. Covariates of age, sex, BMI, smoking and Charlson Comorbidity Index were determined at baseline. Outcomes were total and cause-specific mortality over 12 years.

Lower household income was associated with higher mortality from all causes, cardiovascular disease, cancer and non-cancer non-cardiovascular causes. Excessive mortality due to low incomes was observed in both people with and without diabetes. In men, the adjusted HR [95% confidence interval (CI)] of mortality was 1.38 (1.34 to 1.42) for low-income only, 1.48 (1.42 to 1.55) for diabetes only and 1.95 (1.86 to 2.05) for diabetes and low-income combined, relative to the normal glucose and high income group.

However, it is unclear whether the association between depressive symptoms and CHD risk might differ according to three SES indicators (education, occupational status and household monthly income).
Among 34,836 working participants of the French CONSTANCES cohort (16,221 men, mean age [SD]: 44.0 [10.4] years) without history of cardiovascular disease, depressive symptoms were assessed with the Center of Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D). The Framingham risk equation calibrated to the French population estimated the participant's 10-year risk of CHD. Associations between depressive symptoms and CHD risk were estimated using linear regression models in SES strata.
The estimated 10-year risk of CHD was 16.9% in men and 1.8% in women. In men, the increased CHD risk in those with (versus without) depressive symptoms was more pronounced as occupational status decreased, being 0.65% (-0.57; 1.88), 1.58% (0.50; 2.66) and 3.19% (1.30; 5.07) higher in individuals of high, medium and low occupational status, respectively (p for interaction: 0.01). In contrast, effect modification by education or household income was less evident, despite similar trends. In women, no effect modification was found whatever the SES indicator.

Patients' self-reported household income. Patients' personal information obtained from clinical records and linkages to administrative data to adjust for confounders; personal information was used to adjust for health factors as confounders of the relationship between income and mortality risk.
Of the 1064 patients who received surveys, 519 (49%) responded. There was no significant difference in the mortality rate between nonresponders and responders. Mortality rates were lower than those in the general population throughout follow-up. Within the patient cohort, mortality rates were elevated for smokers, those who had not consumed alcohol in the year before the survey, and those who had been diagnosed with diabetes, hypertension, or cancer before the survey. After all adjustments were made, mortality rates were lower among patients in the higher-income categories than among those with lower household incomes.
Universal health care does not eliminate income-related differentials in mortality. Differences in health-related behaviour factors are not sufficient to explain the socioeconomic mortality differences within an area. These data suggest that it is not solely personal choice related to health behaviour but that other explanations must be invoked to account for the relationship between lower household income and increased mortality rates.

We used Cox proportional hazards models to examine the association of socioeconomic status with incident hypertension using race-specific neighborhood socioeconomic status, median household income, and education among 3372 participants (mean age, 61 years) from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study at Visit 4 (1996-1998). Incident hypertension was defined as self-reported diagnosis or reported use of antihypertensive medications.
Over a median follow-up time of 9.4 years, there were 1874 new cases of hypertension (62.1 per 1000 person-years). Overall, being in high as compared with low socioeconomic status categories was associated with a lower risk of developing hypertension in late life, with hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) of 0.87 (0.77-0.98) for high neighborhood socioeconomic status tertile, 0.79 (0.69-0.90) for high individual income, and 0.75 (0.63-0.89) for college education after adjustment for traditional risk factors. These findings were consistent and robust whenever accounting for competing risks of all-cause mortality. No significant interactions by race and age (dichotomized at age 65) were observed.
Among participants free of hypertension in midlife, high neighborhood and individual socioeconomic status are associated with a decreased risk of incident hypertension.

The present study assessed the longitudinal relationship between frailty and mortality risk in Japanese community-dwelling older adults.
Participants included 841 randomly chosen community-dwelling Japanese individuals, including 175 older adults aged 65-88 years with incomplete data at the baseline examination (July 2006-July 2008). Participants were followed from baseline to 31 December 2015 (mean 7.9 years). Frailty was diagnosed according to frailty criteria, including unintentional weight loss (shrinking), exhaustion, low activity, low grip strength and low gait speed. Information on deaths was obtained from a population dynamics survey. The relationship between frailty and mortality was assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox proportional hazards regression. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to control for potential confounders, including age at baseline, body fat, education, the Mini-Mental State Examination score, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale score, total physical activity, total caloric intake, alcohol intake, current smoking, household income and the number of current diseases.
The fully adjusted hazard ratio for all-cause mortality in the frailty group was 2.63 (95% confidence interval, 1.28-5.39; P for trend <0.01). The age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio for mortality of cancer in the frailty group was 3.33 (95% confidence interval, 1.15-9.62; P for trend <0.05).

In this study, we pooled data from observational pediatric HIV cohorts and cohort networks, allowing comparisons of adolescents with perinatally acquired HIV in ""real-life"" settings across multiple regions. We describe the geographic and temporal characteristics and mortality outcomes of APHs across multiple regions, including South America and the Caribbean, North America, Europe, sub-Saharan Africa, and South and Southeast Asia.
Through the Collaborative Initiative for Paediatric HIV Education and Research (CIPHER), individual retrospective longitudinal data from 12 cohort networks were pooled. All children infected with HIV who entered care before age 10 years, were not known to have horizontally acquired HIV, and were followed up beyond age 10 years were included in this analysis conducted from May 2016 to January 2017. Our primary analysis describes patient and treatment characteristics of APHs at key time points, including first HIV-associated clinic visit, antiretroviral therapy (ART) start, age 10 years, and last visit, and compares these characteristics by geographic region, country income group (CIG), and birth period. Our secondary analysis describes mortality, transfer out, and lost to follow-up (LTFU) as outcomes at age 15 years, using competing risk analysis. Among the 38,187 APHs included, 51% were female, 79% were from sub-Saharan Africa and 65% lived in low-income countries. APHs from 51 countries were included (Europe: 14 countries and 3,054 APHs; North America: 1 country and 1,032 APHs; South America and the Caribbean: 4 countries and 903 APHs; South and Southeast Asia: 7 countries and 2,902 APHs; sub-Saharan Africa, 25 countries and 30,296 APHs). Observation started as early as 1982 in Europe and 1996 in sub-Saharan Africa, and continued until at least 2014 in all regions. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) duration of adolescent follow-up was 3.1 (1.5-5.2) years for the total cohort and 6.4 (3.6-8.0) years in Europe, 3.7 (2.0-5.4) years in North America, 2.5 (1.2-4.4) years in South and Southeast Asia, 5.0 (2.7-7.5) years in South America and the Caribbean, and 2.1 (0.9-3.8) years in sub-Saharan Africa. Median (IQR) age at first visit differed substantially by region, ranging from 0.7 (0.3-2.1) years in North America to 7.1 (5.3-8.6) years in sub-Saharan Africa. The median age at ART start varied from 0.9 (0.4-2.6) years in North America to 7.9 (6.0-9.3) years in sub-Saharan Africa. The cumulative incidence estimates (95% confidence interval [CI]) at age 15 years for mortality, transfers out, and LTFU for all APHs were 2.6% (2.4%-2.8%), 15.6% (15.1%-16.0%), and 11.3% (10.9%-11.8%), respectively. Mortality was lowest in Europe (0.8% [0.5%-1.1%]) and highest in South America and the Caribbean (4.4% [3.1%-6.1%]). However, LTFU was lowest in South America and the Caribbean (4.8% [3.4%-6.7%]) and highest in sub-Saharan Africa (13.2% [12.6%-13.7%]). Study limitations include the high LTFU rate in sub-Saharan Africa, which could have affected the comparison of mortality across regions; inclusion of data only for APHs receiving ART from some countries; and unavailability of data from high-burden countries such as Nigeria.

We analyzed data for 505,677 participants (53.9% men) in the National Health Insurance Service-National Health Screening (NHIS-HEALS) cohort. The study endpoint variable was all-cause mortality.
Frequency of exercise and covariates including age, sex, smoking status, household income, blood pressure, fasting glucose, body mass index, total cholesterol, and Charlson comorbidity index were determined at baseline. Cox proportional hazard regression models were developed to assess the effects of exercise frequency (0, 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, and 7 days per week) on mortality, separately in individuals with and without DM. We found a U-shaped association between exercise frequency and mortality in individuals with and without DM.

Small newborns have an increased risk for mortality, growth failure, and other adverse outcomes. Numerous antenatal risk factors for small newborn size have been identified, but individual interventions addressing them have not markedly improved the health outcomes of interest. We tested a hypothesis that in low-income settings, newborn size is influenced jointly by multiple maternal exposures and characterized pathways associating these exposures with newborn size. This was a prospective cohort study of pregnant women and their offspring nested in an intervention trial in rural Malawi. We collected information on maternal and placental characteristics and used regression analyses, structural equation modelling, and random forest models to build pathway maps for direct and indirect associations between these characteristics and newborn weight-for-age Z-score and length-for-age Z-score. We used multiple imputation to infer values for any missing data. Among 1,179 pregnant women and their babies, newborn weight-for-age Z-score was directly predicted by maternal primiparity, body mass index, and plasma alpha-1-acid glycoprotein concentration before 20 weeks of gestation, gestational weight gain, duration of pregnancy, placental weight, and newborn length-for-age Z-score (p < .05). The latter 5 variables were interconnected and were predicted by several more distal determinants. In low-income conditions like rural Malawi, maternal infections, inflammation, nutrition, and certain constitutional factors jointly influence newborn size. Because of this complex network, comprehensive interventions that concurrently address multiple adverse exposures are more likely to increase mean newborn size than focused interventions targeting only maternal nutrition or specific infections.",Low birthweight is associated with adverse outcomes.,How do maternal exposures jointly influence newborn size in low-income settings?,"Prospective cohort study in rural Malawi, assessing maternal and placental characteristics.","Multiple maternal exposures collectively influence newborn size, suggesting the need for comprehensive interventions.","Data based on a specific region, potential unmeasured confounders."

A retrospective study.
Older adults (≥65 years) visiting the ED, in the Netherlands. SES was stratified into tertiles based on average household income at zip code level: low (<€1800/month), intermediate (€1800-€2300/month) and high (>€2300/month).
Hospitalisation, inhospital mortality and 30-day ED return visits. Effect of SES on outcomes for all groups were assessed by logistic regression and adjusted for confounders.
In total, 4828 older adults visited the ED during the study period. Low SES was associated with a higher risk of hospitalisation among community-dwelling patients compared with high SES (adjusted OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.7). This association was not present for intermediate SES (adjusted OR 1.1, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.4).

Mortality from cancer (n=2,471), cardiovascular diseases (n=3,005), and all-causes (n=10,099) was identified from the National Death Index through December 31, 2013 (median follow-up, 8 years). Data were analyzed in 2016 and 2017. Associations were assessed between mortality, a neighborhood deprivation index composed of 11 census tract-level variables, five health behaviors, and a composite healthy lifestyle score.
Living in a neighborhood with the greatest socioeconomic disadvantage was associated with higher all-cause mortality in both men (hazard ratio=1.41, 95% CI=1.27, 1.57) and women (hazard ratio=1.77, 95% CI=1.57, 2.00).

We enrolled 559 HIV-infected Ugandan adults starting ART in 2004-2005 at the Infectious Diseases Institute in Kampala, Uganda and followed them for 10 years. We documented baseline employment status, regular household income, education level, housing description, physical ability, and CD4 count. Viral load was measured every six months. Proportional hazard regression tested for associations between baseline characteristics and 1) mortality, 2) virologic failure, and 3) mortality or virologic failure as a composite outcome.

In Kaplan-Meier analysis we observed an association between employment and mortality, with the highest cumulative probability of death occurring in unemployed individuals. In univariate analysis unemployment and disease severity were associated with mortality, but in multivariable analysis the only association with mortality was disease severity. We observed an association between higher household income and an increased incidence of both virologic failure and the combined outcome, and an association between self-employment and lower incidence of virologic failure and the combined outcome when compared to unemployment. Formal education level and housing status were unrelated to outcomes. It is feasible to achieve good ten-year survival, retention-in-care, and viral suppression in a socioeconomically diverse population in a resource-limited setting.

However, there are only a few studies that have examined age, period, and cohort dependent influences of SES disparities on late-life disabilities. We investigated associations between SES disparities and late-life disability based on the Age-Period-Cohort. We also investigated how macro-economic conditions unique to a period, or a cohort might explain the period or the cohort trends.
Data were obtained from people aged 65 and over that responded to the Comprehensive Survey of Living Conditions, which had been conducted every three years from 1989 to 2013. SES was assessed via household income. Disability was assessed as disabilities in performing Basic Activities of Daily Living (BADL). Income disparities were evaluated by the slope index of inequality (SII) and the relative index of inequality (RII). Each Age-Period-Cohort dimension was simultaneously controlled using a model for cross-classification of random effects.
Differences in BADL disabilities due to income disparities decreased with age and reversed after approximately 80 years of age. Income disparities in BADL disability changed across periods, by increasing in periods with a high unemployment rate, which started two to four years before the period. Moreover, results of using SII and RII were nearly identical.
Higher mortality in elderly with lower income might be related to a reduction of income disparities in BADL disability in Japan.

Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were utilized to assess the associations between physical activity and all-cause mortality in 2,370 patients with CVD. Participants who achieved a volume of all physical activities of ≥1,000 kcal/week experienced lower risks of all-cause mortality than those who achieved less. Additionally, an inverse relation between LTPA and all-cause mortality was observed. Furthermore, participants who reported exertions (1 to 999 kcal/week) in DWPA had the lowest risk of all-cause mortality. This study provides evidence that patients with CVD who achieve at least a moderate volume of physical activity reduce their mortality risk. It also reveals that both LTPA and DWPA may be important contributors to the reduced risk of premature death among this clinical population.",,,,,

This is a population-based, retrospective cohort study using the 2012-2013 State Inpatient Databases of seven U.S. states (Arkansas, Florida, Iowa, Nebraska, New York, Utah, and Washington). We included adults (aged ≥40 yr) hospitalized for acute exacerbation of COPD. Obesity, use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), and use of invasive mechanical ventilation were determined by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes. To examine associations between obesity and each outcome (NIPPV, invasive mechanical ventilation, hospital length of stay (LOS), and in-hospital mortality), we fit unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression models using generalized estimating equations to account for patient clustering within hospitals. We adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, primary payer, median household income, patient residence, hospitalization year, chronic comorbidities, and hospital state. In the sensitivity analysis, we used stabilized inverse probability weighting to estimate the causal relation of obesity with outcomes in this observational study.
Of 187,647 patients hospitalized for an acute exacerbation of COPD, 17% were obese. Obesity was associated with increased use of both NIPPV (12.0% vs. 6.5%; adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.86; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.77-1.95; P < 0.001) and invasive mechanical ventilation (3.5% vs. 2.8%; adjusted OR = 1.13; 95% CI = 1.04-1.22; P = 0.003).

Weight and WC were reassessed three years after baseline. Mortality risk associated with a 5% weight/WC loss and gain was compared to that of weight/WC stability by Cox models adjusted for clinical, behavioral and social known risk factors for death (age, gender, BMI, smoking, diabetes, total cholesterol, hypertension, Chagas disease, major electrocardiographic changes, physical activity, B-type natriuretic peptide, C-reactive protein, creatinine, education and household income).
Female sex was predominant (718; 63.1%). Mean age was 68 (6.7) years. Weight stability (696; 61.1%) was more common than weight loss (251; 22.1%) or gain (191; 16.8%). WC remained stable in 422 (37.3%), decreased in 418 (37.0%) and increased in 291 (25.7%) participants. There were 334 (29.3%) deaths over a median follow-up time of 8.0 (6.4-8.0) years from weight/WC reassessment. Weight loss (HR 1.69; 95% CI 1.30-2.21) and gain (HR 1.37; 95% CI 1.01-1.85) were associated with increased mortality, except in those who were physically active in which weight gain was associated with decreased mortality. Results were similar for participants who were overweight/obese or with abdominal obesity at baseline (HR 1.41; 95%CI 1.02-1.97 and HR 2.01; 95%CI 1.29-3.12, for weight loss and gain, respectively). WC change was not significantly associated with mortality.
Although weight loss has been recommended for adults with excessive weight regardless of age, weight change might be detrimental in older adults. Rather than weight loss, clinical interventions should target healthy lifestyle behaviors that contribute to weight stability, particularly physical activity in overweight and obese older adults.",,,,,

We examined whether different amounts and types of physical activity are associated with lower mortality and CVD in countries at different economic levels.
In this prospective cohort study, we recruited participants from 17 countries (Canada, Sweden, United Arab Emirates, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Poland, Turkey, Malaysia, South Africa, China, Colombia, Iran, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Zimbabwe). Within each country, urban and rural areas in and around selected cities and towns were identified to reflect the geographical diversity. Within these communities, we invited individuals aged between 35 and 70 years who intended to live at their current address for at least another 4 years. Total physical activity was assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPQA). Participants with pre-existing CVD were excluded from the analyses. Mortality and CVD were recorded during a mean of 6·9 years of follow-up. Primary clinical outcomes during follow-up were mortality plus major CVD (CVD mortality, incident myocardial infarction, stroke, or heart failure), either as a composite or separately. The effects of physical activity on mortality and CVD were adjusted for sociodemographic factors and other risk factors taking into account household, community, and country clustering.
Between Jan 1, 2003, and Dec 31, 2010, 168 916 participants were enrolled, of whom 141 945 completed the IPAQ. Analyses were limited to the 130 843 participants without pre-existing CVD. Compared with low physical activity (<600 metabolic equivalents [MET] × minutes per week or <150 minutes per week of moderate intensity physical activity), moderate (600-3000 MET × minutes or 150-750 minutes per week) and high physical activity (>3000 MET × minutes or >750 minutes per week) were associated with graded reduction in mortality (hazard ratio 0·80, 95% CI 0·74-0·87 and 0·65, 0·60-0·71; p<0·0001 for trend), and major CVD (0·86, 0·78-0·93; p<0·001 for trend). Higher physical activity was associated with lower risk of CVD and mortality in high-income, middle-income, and low-income countries. The adjusted population attributable fraction for not meeting the physical activity guidelines was 8·0% for mortality and 4·6% for major CVD, and for not meeting high physical activity was 13·0% for mortality and 9·5% for major CVD. Both recreational and non-recreational physical activity were associated with benefits.
Higher recreational and non-recreational physical activity was associated with a lower risk of mortality and CVD events in individuals from low-income, middle-income, and high-income countries. Increasing physical activity is a simple, widely applicable, low cost global strategy that could reduce deaths and CVD in middle age.

We assessed the association of area-level and individual-level indicators of poverty and race/ethnicity on pre-ESRD care provided by nephrologists.
In this retrospective cohort study using the US Renal Data System database, we identified 739 537 patients initiated on maintenance dialysis from 1 January 2007 through 31 December 2012. We assessed the Medicare-Medicaid dual eligibility status as an indicator of individual-level poverty and ZIP code-level median household income (MHI) data obtained from the 2010 US census. We conducted multivariable logistic regression of pre-ESRD nephrology care as the outcome variable.
Among patients in the lowest area-level MHI quintile, 61.28% received pre-ESRD nephrology care versus 67.68% among those in higher quintiles (P < 0.001). Similarly, the proportions of dual-eligible and nondual-eligible patients who had pre-ESRD nephrology care were 61.49 and 69.84%, respectively (P < 0.001). Patients in the lowest area-level MHI quintile were associated with significantly lower likelihood of pre-ESRD nephrology care (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.86 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85-0.87]) compared with those in higher quintiles. Both African American (AA) and Hispanic patients were significantly less likely to have received pre-ESRD nephrology care [aOR 0.85 (95% CI 0.84-0.86) and aOR 0.72 (95% CI 0.71-0.74), respectively].

It is unclear if this increased harm reflects differences in alcohol consumption between these socioeconomic groups, reverse causation (ie, downward social selection for high-risk drinkers), or a greater risk of harm in individuals of low socioeconomic status compared with those of higher status after similar consumption. We aimed to investigate whether the harmful effects of alcohol differ by socioeconomic status, accounting for alcohol consumption and other health-related factors.
The Scottish Health Surveys are record-linked cross-sectional surveys representative of the adult population of Scotland. We obtained baseline demographics and data for alcohol consumption (units per week and binge drinking) from Scottish Health Surveys done in 1995, 1998, 2003, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012. We matched these data to records for deaths, admissions, and prescriptions. The primary outcome was alcohol-attributable admission or death. The relation between alcohol-attributable harm and socioeconomic status was investigated for four measures (education level, social class, household income, and area-based deprivation) using Cox proportional hazards models. The potential for alcohol consumption and other risk factors (including smoking and body-mass index [BMI]) mediating social patterning was explored in separate regression models. Reverse causation was tested by comparing change in area deprivation over time.
50 236 participants (21 777 men and 28 459 women) were included in the analytical sample, with 429 986 person-years of follow-up. Low socioeconomic status was associated consistently with strikingly raised alcohol-attributable harms, including after adjustment for weekly consumption, binge drinking, BMI, and smoking. Evidence was noted of effect modification; for example, relative to light drinkers living in advantaged areas, the risk of alcohol-attributable admission or death for excessive drinkers was increased (hazard ratio 6·12, 95% CI 4·45-8·41 in advantaged areas; and 10·22, 7·73-13·53 in deprived areas). We found little support for reverse causation.
Disadvantaged social groups have greater alcohol-attributable harms compared with individuals from advantaged areas for given levels of alcohol consumption, even after accounting for different drinking patterns, obesity, and smoking status at the individual level.

We sought to identify risk factors that might explain the increased mortality in socially isolated and lonely individuals.
We used prospective follow-up data from the UK Biobank cohort study to assess self-reported isolation (a three-item scale) and loneliness (two questions). The main outcomes were all-cause and cause-specific mortality. We calculated the percentage of excess risk mediated by risk factors to assess the extent to which the associations of social isolation and loneliness with mortality were attributable to differences between isolated and lonely individuals and others in biological (body-mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and handgrip strength), behavioural (smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity), socioeconomic (education, neighbourhood deprivation, and household income), and psychological (depressive symptoms and cognitive capacity) risk factors.
466 901 men and women (mean age at baseline 56·5 years [SD 8·1]) were included in the analyses, with a mean follow-up of 6·5 years (SD 0·8). The hazard ratio for all-cause mortality for social isolation compared with no social isolation was 1·73 (95% CI 1·65-1·82) after adjustment for age, sex, ethnic origin, and chronic disease (ie, minimally adjusted), and was 1·26 (95% CI 1·20-1·33) after further adjustment for socioeconomic factors, health-related behaviours, depressive symptoms, biological factors, cognitive performance, and self-rated health (ie, fully adjusted). The minimally adjusted hazard ratio for mortality risk related to loneliness was 1·38 (95% CI 1·30-1·47), which reduced to 0·99 (95% CI 0·93-1·06) after full adjustment for baseline risks.

Interviews with 7,069 women aged 15-49 in 96 randomly selected clusters of communities in 24 Local Government Areas (LGAs) across Jigawa state were conducted. A retrospective cohort of their sisters of reproductive age was constructed to calculate the lifetime risk of maternal mortality. Using most recent estimates of total fertility for the state, the MMR was estimated.
The 7,069 respondents reported 10,957 sisters who reached reproductive age. Of the 1,026 deaths in these sisters, 300 (29.2%) occurred during pregnancy, childbirth or within 42 days after delivery.

CSR was defined by assigning a score of 1 for the presence of each of 4 social factors: i) racial minority status (Black race), ii) single living status, iii) low income, and iv) low educational level. Hazard ratios (HRs) were computed using Cox-regression models, adjusted for CVD risk factors. Over a median follow-up period of 8.3 years, 127 incident events were observed.

Two new methods to rapidly estimate under-5 mortality based on Summary Birth Histories (SBH) were described in a previous paper and tested with data available. This analysis tests the methods using data appropriate to each method from 5 countries that lack vital registration systems. SBH data are collected across many countries through censuses and surveys, and indirect methods often rely upon their quality to estimate mortality rates.
The Birth History Imputation method imputes data from a recent Full Birth History (FBH) onto the birth, death and age distribution of the SBH to produce estimates based on the resulting distribution of child mortality. DHS FBHs and MICS SBHs are used for all five countries. In the implementation, 43 of 70 estimates are within 20% of validation estimates (61%). Mean Absolute Relative Error is 17.7.%. 1 of 7 countries produces acceptable estimates. The Cohort Change method considers the differences in births and deaths between repeated Summary Birth Histories at 1 or 2-year intervals to estimate the mortality rate in that period. SBHs are taken from Brazil's PNAD Surveys 2004-2011 and validated against IGME estimates. 2 of 10 estimates are within 10% of validation estimates. Mean absolute relative error is greater than 100%.
Appropriate testing of these new methods demonstrates that they do not produce sufficiently good estimates based on the data available.

After controlling for severity of sepsis, residing in the lowest income quartile compared to the highest quartile was associated with a higher risk of mortality (odds ratio [OR]: 1.06, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03-1.08, P < .01). There was no association seen between the second (OR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.99-1.05, P = .14) and third (OR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.97-1.01, P = .40) quartiles compared to the highest.

The large-scale implementation of effective interventions for treating alcohol problems remains a challenge in low-income countries with generalized HIV epidemics. It is essential to consider an intervention's cost-effectiveness in dollars-per-health-outcome, and the long-term economic impact -or ""return on investment"" in monetary terms.
We conducted a cost-benefit analysis, measuring economic return on investment, of a task-shifted cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention delivered by paraprofessionals to reduce alcohol use in a modeled cohort of 13,440 outpatients in Kenya. In our base-case, we estimated the costs and economic benefits from a societal perspective across a six-year time horizon, with a 3% annual discount rate. Costs included all costs associated with training and administering task-shifted CBT therapy. Benefits included the economic impact of lowered HIV incidence as well as the improvements in household and labor-force productivity. We conducted univariate and multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of our results.
Under the base case, total costs for CBT rollout was $554,000, the value of benefits were $628,000, and the benefit-to-cost ratio was 1.13. Sensitivity analyses showed that under most assumptions, the benefit-to-cost ratio remained above unity indicating that the intervention was cost-saving (i.e., had positive return on investment). The duration of the treatment effect most effected the results in sensitivity analyses.
CBT can be effectively and economically task-shifted to paraprofessionals in Kenya. The intervention can generate not only reductions in morbidity and mortality, but also economic savings for the health system in the medium and long term. The findings have implications for other countries with generalized HIV epidemics, high prevalence of alcohol consumption, and shortages of mental health professionals.

The 2012-2014 ASEAN Costs in Oncology Study prospectively followed-up 9513 newly diagnosed cancer patients from eight LMIC in Southeast Asia for 12 months. Overall and country-specific incidence of financial catastrophe (out-of-pocket health costs ≥ 30% of annual household income), economic hardship (inability to make necessary household payments), poverty (living below national poverty line), and all-cause mortality were determined. Stepwise multinomial regression was used to estimate the extent to which health insurance, cancer stage and treatment explained these outcomes.
The one-year incidence of mortality (12% in Malaysia to 45% in Myanmar) and financial catastrophe (24% in Thailand to 68% in Vietnam) were high. Economic hardship was reported by a third of families, including inability to pay for medicines (45%), mortgages (18%) and utilities (12%), with 28% taking personal loans, and 20% selling assets (not mutually exclusive). Out of households that initially reported incomes above the national poverty levels, 4·9% were pushed into poverty at one year. The adverse economic outcomes in this study were mainly attributed to medical costs for inpatient/outpatient care, and purchase of drugs and medical supplies. In all the countries, cancer stage largely explained the risk of adverse outcomes. Stage-stratified analysis however showed that low-income patients remained vulnerable to adverse outcomes even when diagnosed with earlier cancer stages.
The LMIC need to realign their focus on early detection of cancer and provision of affordable cancer care, while ensuring adequate financial risk protection, particularly for the poor.",,,,,

Research based on Canadian cohorts suggests that exposure to PM2.5 varies by demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. Studies of NO₂, another pollutant, indicate that persons of lower socioeconomic status and some visible minority groups have greater exposure in urban centres.
National residential PM2.5 was estimated from a ~1 km² spatial layer for respondents to the 2006 Census long-form questionnaire. Weighted PM2.5 estimates from personal-level estimates were determined for white, Aboriginal, visible minority and immigrant populations, as well as for socioeconomic groups (household income, educational attainment) and stratified by urban core, urban fringe and rural residence. Descriptive statistics were provided for selected comparisons.
In Canada, PM2.5 exposure was 1.61 μg/m³ higher for visible minority (versus white) populations, and 1.55 μg/m³ higher for immigrants (versus non-immigrants). When the relatively high percentages of these groups in large cities were taken into account, exposure differences in urban cores were much smaller. Exposure among urban immigrants did not decrease substantially with time since immigration (< 0.5 μg/m³ between any two years). In urban cores, residents of low-income households had marginally higher exposure (0.56 μg/m³) than did people who were not in low-income households.
Differences between specific population groups in exposure to PM2.5 are due, at least in part, to higher percentages of these groups living in urban cores where air pollution levels are elevated.",,,,,

We calculated in-hospital mortality for those patients who underwent OHT during the same admission as a function of time from LVAD to OHT, adjusting for age, sex, race, household income, and number of comorbid diagnoses. Finally, we analyzed the effect of time to OHT after LVAD implantation on the length of hospital stay post-transplant.
Two thousand and two hundred patients underwent implantation of a LVAD in this cohort. One hundred and sixty-four (7.5%) patients also underwent OHT during the same admission, which occurred on average 32 d (IQR 7.75-66 d) after LVAD implantation.

Aim of this study is to determine whether the surgical advantages of the DIEP flap impact postoperative outcomes versus the free TRAM flap (fTRAM).
We reviewed the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database (2010-2011) for all cases of DIEP and fTRAM breast reconstruction. Inclusion criteria were: female sex and patients undergoing DIEP or fTRAM total breast reconstruction. Male sex was excluded from the analysis. We examined demographic characteristics, hospital setting, insurance information, patient income, comorbidities, postoperative complications (including reoperation, hemorrhage, hematoma, seroma, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolus, wound infection, and flap loss), length of stay, and total charges (TCs). Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify independent risk factors of increased length of stay and TCs.

Internet queries identifying 26 professional football players who completed suicide. Obituaries and news reports were reviewed. The primary outcome measures included mortality, demographic characteristics and life circumstances in professional American football players completing suicide.
From 1920-2015, the median age of the 26 men who completed suicide was 39.5 years (range = 23-85). The median number of years after retirement was 6.5 (range = 0-63). Most of the deaths since 1920 have occurred in the past 15 years (58.7%) and a large percentage have occurred since 2009 (42.3%). Most of the men suffered from multiple life stressors prior to their deaths, such as retirement from sport, loss of steady income, divorce, failed business ventures, estrangement from family members and medical, psychiatric and/or substance abuse problems.
A disproportionate number of completed suicides in current and former professional football players have occurred since 2009 (42.3%). It is well established in the literature that the causes of depression and suicidality are diverse, often multifactorial and treatable.

Using multiple cohorts of the National Longitudinal Mortality Study (NLMS), we estimate the absolute income effect on premature mortality in the United States. A multivariate Poisson regression using the natural logarithm of equivilized household income establishes the magnitude of the absolute income effect on mortality. We calculate mortality rates for each income decile of the study sample and mortality rate ratios relative to the decile containing mean income. We then apply the estimated income effect to two kinds of hypothetical interventions that would redistribute income. The first lifts everyone with an equivalized household income at or below the U.S. poverty line (in 2000$) out of poverty, to the income category just above the poverty line. The second shifts each family's equivalized income by, in turn, 10%, 20%, 30%, or 40% toward the mean household income, equivalent to reducing the Gini coefficient by the same percentage in each scenario. We also assess mortality disparities of the hypothetical interventions using ratios of mortality rates of the ninth and second income deciles, and test sensitivity to the assumption of causality of income on mortality by halving the mortality effect per unit of equivalized household income. The estimated absolute income effect would produce a three to four percent reduction in mortality for a 10% reduction in the Gini coefficient. Larger mortality reductions result from larger reductions in the Gini, but with diminishing returns. Inequalities in estimated mortality rates are reduced by a larger percentage than overall estimated mortality rates under the same hypothetical redistributions.","Income inequality may impact mortality rates, but individual-level evidence is lacking.","What is the absolute income effect on premature mortality in the United States, and how does income inequality impact mortality rates?","Used multiple cohorts of the National Longitudinal Mortality Study, estimated income effect on mortality rates.","Income gradient in mortality was curvilinear, with higher incomes providing diminishing returns.

We analysed data from the 2002 to 2012 National Inpatient Sample, including a representative 20% sample of all hospitalizations in the U.S.A. (72 108 077 adults).
The prevalence of hospitalization for BP increased from 25·84 to 32·60 cases per million inpatients from 2002 to 2012. In multivariate logistic regression models with stepwise selection, increasing age, nonwhite ethnicity, higher median household income, being insured with Medicare or Medicaid, and increasing number of chronic conditions were all associated with hospitalization for BP (P < 0·05 for all). The top three primary discharge diagnoses for patients with a secondary diagnosis of BP were septicaemia (prevalence 5·51%, 95% confidence interval 5·03-5·99), pneumonia (4·60%, 4·19-5·01) and urinary tract infection (3·52%, 3·15-3·89). Patients with BP also had numerous autoimmune, infectious, cardiovascular and other comorbidities.

In 2005 mortality rate under 5 in Colombia was 21.5 per 1000, with a reduction of 82% between 2005 and 1955. That rate is not in line with rates for Cuba (6.8), Chile (9.1) or Costa Rica (10.4). Here we aim to provide evidence that a further reduction of child mortality relates to the unspoken racial gap in a pioneering country in family planning and praised in the 2000 WHO report as having the world's fairest health care reform in terms of coverage and financial access.
The lack of nationally representative data to estimate black/white differences in child mortality is overcome by using the ratio of children born and alive as the measure of mortality and the 2005 census data from IPUMS-I, which provides racial categories based on self-identification. The working sample contains 617,985 mothers between 15 and 49 years of age, of whom 7.7% have experienced the death of at least one child. Using individual weights, a logistic regression is regressed on race, individual and community socio-economic status (SES), and demographic variables. Second, a model by cohort is regressed to capture the evolution of the racial gap over time. Third, interactions are run to examine the racial gap across SES groups.
The chances of losing a child are over 25% higher among black mothers relative to white mothers after controlling for individual and community SES characteristics.

Incidence and predictors of HRHO were examined among older adults living in Quebec (Canada).
This prospective five-year study used data from the first follow-up of community-dwelling older adults from the NuAge cohort (2005-2006), located in three health regions of Southern Quebec. Medical, social and environmental factors, identified in Health Canada guidelines (2011), were used to develop the Older Adult Health Vulnerability Index (OAHVI). HRHO, obtained from a medico-administrative database, were defined as events occurring on a hot day (maximal temperature ≥30°C) between 2006 and 2010. Two outcomes were examined: heat-related 1) emergency department presentations (EDPs) and 2) health events (i.e., EDP, hospitalizations or deaths). Multivariate logistic regressions were performed to assess the associations between risk and protective factors, including OAHVI, and both outcomes.
EDP and hospitalizations were, respectively, 2.6 (95% CI: 2.0-3.5) and 1.7 (95% CI: 1.1-2.6) times more frequent on hot days compared to normal summer days.

The study is based on a total Swedish population cohort between the ages of 50 and 60 years in 1990 (n=801,017) followed in registers for up to 19 years. We measured equivalent disposable household income in 1990 and 2005 and mortality between 2006 and 2009. Cox proportional hazard models with penalized splines (P-spline) enabled us to examine for non-linearity in the relationship between income and mortality. The results showed a clear non-linear association. The shape of the association between midlife (ages 50-60) income and mortality was curvilinear; returns diminished as income increased. The shape of the association between late-life (ages 65-75) income and mortality was also curvilinear; returns diminished as income increased. The association between late-life income and mortality remained after controlling for midlife income. In summary, the results indicated that a non-linear association between income and mortality is maintained into old age, in which higher incomes give diminishing returns.",,,,,

At the time the current study began, most other studies had been conducted in the United States or Europe. Dr. Zhengmin Qian proposed to extend work he had done on ambient particulate air pollution and daily mortality in Wuhan, China (Qian et al. 2010), as part of the HEIsponsored Public Health and Air Pollution in Asia program, to study adverse birth outcomes. Wuhan is the capital city of Hubei province, has a large population of about 6.4 million within the urban study area, experiences temperature extremes, and generally has higher air pollution levels than those observed in the United States and Europe, thus providing a good opportunity to explore questions about air pollution and health.
Qian and colleagues planned a cohort and nested case–control design with four specific aims, examining whether increased exposures to air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, O3, and CO) during vulnerable pregnancy periods were associated with increased rates of PTB, LBW (<2500 g), or intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR, defined as having a birth weight below the 10th percentile of singleton live births in Wuhan) after adjusting for major risk factors and whether the associations were confounded by copollutant exposures, affected by residual confounding, or modified by temperature extremes, socioeconomic status (SES), or secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure. The cohort study included 95,911 births that occurred from June 10, 2011, to June 9, 2013, and met typical prespecified inclusion criteria used in other birth outcome studies. The case–control study included 3146 cases (PTB, LBW, or both, but not IUGR) and 4263 controls (matched to the cases by birth month) for whom investigators were able to complete home visits and questionnaires. The investigators obtained air pollution and daily weather data for August 2010 to June 2013 from nine monitoring stations representing background air pollution sites in seven Wuhan inner-city districts. Only two of these stations provided PM2.5 data. For the cohort study, the investigators assigned exposures to mothers according to the daily mean concentrations from the monitor nearest the residential community in which the mother lived at the time of the birth. For the case–control study, they assigned exposures based on the inverse distance weighted average of daily mean concentrations from the three nearest monitors, for all but PM2.5 for which the method was not specified. They also collected data on various factors that might confound or modify the impact of the pollutants on the adverse outcomes, including data collected in the cohort from mothers at the time of delivery and, in the case–control study, from questionnaires administered to mothers. In the case–control study, covariates representing SES (as indicated by the mother’s educational attainment and household income) and SHS exposures were of particular interest. The primary statistical analyses of the pollutant associations with PTB, LBW, and IUGR were conducted using logistic regression models. In the cohort study, exposures during the pregnancy period of interest (full term, trimesters, and selected months) were included as continuous variables. In the case–control study, the exposures were modeled as binary variables (i.e., above or below the median pollutant concentrations). Numerous sensitivity analyses were conducted.
Although originally planning a nested case–control study, the investigators encountered challenges that led them to analyze the cohort and case–control studies using different ways of assigning exposures and characterizing them in their statistical models. These decisions precluded direct comparisons between the sets of results, making it difficult to answer the questions about residual confounding that nested case–control studies are designed to answer. The odds ratios from the two study designs using different exposures also have different interpretations. Still, one can ask whether the sets of findings were qualitatively consistent with each other or with those of similar studies. There were some similarities. Both studies suggested that increased PM(2.5), PM(10), CO, and O(3) exposures over the full pregnancy were associated with small increases in the odds of PTB (the case–control study also showed an association with NO2) and that increased PM(2.5) exposures were associated with significantly increased odds of LBW. However, most of the other pollutants had no effect on LBW, except CO in the cohort study and O(3) in the case–control study, both of which increased the odds of LBW. The exposures over the entire pregnancy were generally associated with decreased odds of IUGR. Adjustments for potential confounders were greatest for the delivery covariates. The investigators found no systematic association of any of these outcomes with particular trimesters or months, another result that differed from those of some other studies. They found little evidence that their main results were confounded or modified by the presence of copollutants, although with the exception of O3, most of the pollutants were highly correlated, making it difficult to disentangle the effects of individual pollutants. Could the two sets of data be analyzed in a more comparable way, as in a standard nested case–control study? At the Committee’s request, the investigators reanalyzed the case–control data using the same exposures and models as in the cohort study. The results were strikingly different from those using the inverse distance weighted exposures, modeled as binary variables — the pollutants had either no effect or an apparent beneficial effect on PTB and LBW. The Committee was not convinced by the explanations offered for these differences, leaving the reasons for them unresolved.
This study set out to answer important questions about the effects of air pollution exposure on three measures of adverse birth outcomes — LBW, PTB, and IUGR — in a large cohort of mothers and newborns in Wuhan, China. Given the cohort size, high pollution levels and temperatures, and detailed covariate data, the investigators were well poised to address these questions. They sought to pattern their work on other studies of birth outcomes, were very responsive to Committee questions, and provided many additional analyses and explanations. In the Committee’s view, however, the study was unable to address with confidence several of its specific aims. Most important, the differences in results when the case–control data were analyzed with different exposure metrics remain unexplained, raising concerns about the ability to draw conclusions from subsequent analyses assessing residual confounding and effect modification by temperature extremes, SES, and SHS exposure. Consequently, any individual findings from the cohort and case–control studies should be considered suggestive rather than conclusive, and should be interpreted carefully together.",,,,,

A significant 4-way interaction was a 3-way interaction in non-high poverty neighborhoods only. Private insurance was protective for unmarried men (RR = 1.60) but not women, while it was protective for married women (RR = 1.22) but not men.

We study the determinants of transitions to a nonmarital first birth as a single parent or as a cohabiting parent compared to transitions to marriage prior to a first birth among unmarried, childless young adults in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1997 cohort, from 1997 to 2011. We include measures of county-group-level household income inequality and of the availability of jobs typically held by high-school graduates and which pay above-poverty wages. We find that greater income inequality is associated with a reduced likelihood of transitioning to marriage prior to a first birth for both women and men. The association between levels of inequality and transitions to marriage can be partially accounted for by the availability of jobs of the type we measured.

Operative treatment of lumbar spine compression fractures includes fusion and/or cement augmentation. Our aim was to evaluate postoperative differences in patients treated surgically with fusion, vertebroplasty, or kyphoplasty. Methods. The Nationwide Inpatient Sample Database search for adult vertebral compression fracture patients treated 2004-2011 identified 102,316 surgical patients: 30.6% underwent spinal fusion, 17.1% underwent kyphoplasty, and 49.9% underwent vertebroplasty. Univariate analysis of patient and hospital characteristics, by treatment, was performed. Multivariable analysis was used to determine factors associated with mortality, nonroutine discharge, complications, and patient safety. Results. Average patient age: fusion (46.2), kyphoplasty (78.5), vertebroplasty (76.7) (p < .0001). Gender, race, household income, hospital-specific characteristics, and insurance differences were found (p ≤ .001). Leading comorbidities were hypertension, osteoporosis, and diabetes. Risks for higher mortality (OR 2.0: CI: 1.6-2.5), nonroutine discharge (OR 1.6, CI: 1.6-1.7), complications (OR 1.1, CI: 1.0-1.1), and safety related events (OR 1.1, CI: 1.0-1.1) rose consistently with increasing age, particularly among fusion patients. Preexisting comorbidities and longer in-hospital length of stay were associated with increased odds of nonroutine discharge, complications, and patient safety. Conclusions.

Less is known about the association between SES and mortality in persons with dementia. We studied this association in a prospective cohort of 15,558 patients in the Netherlands between 2000 and 2010. SES was measured using disposable household income and divided in tertiles. Overall, there was a negative relationship between SES and mortality in both sexes and both settings of care. For men who visited a day clinic, the 5-year mortality rate was 74% among those in the lowest tertile of SES and 57% among those in the highest; for women, the rates were 60% and 50%, respectively. The differences in median survival times between persons in the lower and upper tertiles of SES were 260 days for men and 300 days for women. For men who were admitted to the hospital, the 5-year mortality rate was 89% among those in the lowest tertile of SES and 86% among those in the highest; for women, the rates were 83% and 77%, respectively. The differences in median survival times between persons in the lower and upper tertiles of SES were 80 days for men and 130 days for women. Among patients who visited a day clinic, for patients in the lowest tertile of SES versus those in the highest, the adjusted hazard ratio was 1.41 (95% confidence interval: 1.26, 1.57); for those admitted to the hospital, it was 1.14 (95% confidence interval: 1.07, 1.20).

The National Cancer Database was queried for women with cervical cancer treated initially with hysterectomy from 2002 to 2012. Patients without high-risk pathologic features were excluded: pN, positive surgical margins, and parametrial invasion (Peters' criteria). Among the 5947 evaluable patients, univariable analysis and multivariable analysis were performed to investigate potential factors associated with CRT utilization and overall survival following diagnosis.
Adjuvant CRT was performed in 41.8% of women and adjuvant radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and no adjuvant therapy was utilized in 9.8%, 23.6%, and 24.8% of women, respectively. On multivariable analysis, CRT utilization was associated with younger age, race, lower facility volume, pN, parametrial invasion, and a negative surgical margin.

The purpose of this paper is to report on the design and methodology of a population-based cohort study on elder mistreatment among the older Malaysian population. The study aims at gathering data and evidence to estimate the prevalence and incidence of elder mistreatment, identify its individual, familial and social determinants, and quantify its health consequences.
This is a community-based prospective cohort study using randomly selected households from the national census. A multistage sampling method was employed to obtain a total of 2496 older adults living in the rural Kuala Pilah district. The study is divided into two phases: cross-sectional study (baseline), and a longitudinal follow-up study at the third and fifth years. Elder mistreatment was measured using instrument derived from the previous literature and modified Conflict Tactic Scales. Outcomes of elder mistreatment include mortality, physical function, mental health, quality of life and health utilisation. Logistic regression models are used to examine the relationship between risk factors and abuse estimates. Cox proportional hazard regression will be used to estimate risk of mortality associated with abuse. Associated annual rate of hospitalisation and health visit frequency, and reporting of abuse, will be estimated using Poisson regression.
The study has been approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the University of Malaya Medical Center (MEC Ref 902.2) and the Malaysian National Medical Research Register (NMRR-12-1444-11726). Written consent was obtained from all respondents prior to baseline assessment and subsequent follow-up.

This study prospectively investigated the combined influence of major lifestyle factors and poverty on mortality in this vulnerable population.
Data were collected in 2002-2009 from 79,101 Southern Community Cohort Study participants, of which 67% were African American and 55% had household incomes <$15,000. Mortality outcomes were identified from the National Death Index though December 31, 2011 (data analyzed in 2014-2015). Healthy behavior scores were created based on tobacco smoking, alcohol intake, diet, physical activity, and sedentary time. The primary analysis was performed based on the score created by counting each participant as having met/not met public health guidelines for each behavior.
Healthy behavior scores were associated with reduced cancer, cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality. Associations were stronger for whites than African Americans: hazard ratios for all-cause mortality comparing participants meeting four or five guidelines versus participants meeting zero were 0.41 (95% CI=0.30, 0.55) for African American men; 0.36 (95% CI=0.24, 0.55) for white men; 0.46 (95% CI=0.36, 0.59) for African American women; and 0.27 (95% CI=0.18, 0.43) for white women. The association between healthy lifestyle and all-cause mortality was weaker among those with incomes <$15,000 than those with higher income, particularly in men (p<0.05 for interaction).

We assessed the potential improvement in CVD risk stratification of 19 easily available risk markers by adding them to the SCORE algorithm.
We followed 8476 individuals without prior CVD or diabetes from the Copenhagen City Heart study. The 19 risk markers were: major and minor electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities, heart rate, family history (of ischaemic heart disease), body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio, walking duration and pace, leisure time physical activity, forced expiratory volume (FEV)1%pred, household income, education, vital exhaustion, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1), apolipoprotein B (ApoB), high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and fibrinogen. With the exception of family history, BMI, triglycerides and minor ECG changes, all risk markers remained significantly associated with CVD mortality after adjustment for SCORE variables. However, the addition of the remaining 15 risk markers resulted in only small changes in discrimination calculated by area under the curve (AUC) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) and no improvement in net reclassification improvement (NRI). HsCRP improved AUC by 0.006 (p = 0.015) and IDI by 0.012 (p = 0.002); FEV1%pred improved AUC by 0.006 (p = 0.032) and IDI by 0.006 (p = 0.029).

We sought to evaluate the association of health insurance status with mortality among working-age participants with albuminuria in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1988-1994 (NHANES III).
We used data from non-elderly adult participants (18-64) of NHANES III (1988-1994), a nationally representative study of the US civilian, noninstitutionalized population, who provided information on insurance and who had albuminuria, defined as a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio [UACR] ≥ 30 mg/g and their subsequent mortality to December 31, 2006. Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine associations between insurance status and all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality in patients with CKD while adjusting in a stepwise fashion for sociodemographic factors, co-morbidities, and co-morbidity severity/control covariates.
In our sample of individuals with albuminuria (n = 903), mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 101.6 ml/min/1.73 m(2) with 4.7 % with an eGFR <60. Approximately 15 % of the sample was uninsured, 18 % had public insurance and 67 % had private insurance. Compared to individuals with private insurance, those with public insurance or no insurance were significantly more likely to be a racial or ethnic minority, to have income <200 % below the federal poverty level, to have less than high school education; and they were less likely to be married and to report good or excellent health, all p < 0.05. Being uninsured or having public insurance was associated with increased all-cause mortality in the fully adjusted model (HR 2.97 and 3.65, respectively, p < 0.05).

Choice of therapy (surgical vs. non-surgical) and disease-specific survival (DSS).
Age ≥60 years (odds ratio [OR]=0.78; 95% CI, 0.70-0.88) and more recent year of diagnosis (OR=0.89; 95% CI, 0.87-0.90) decreased the odds of receiving surgical therapy, while residing in a county with low median household income (OR=1.36; 95% CI, 1.17-1.57) increased the odds of receiving surgical therapy. Age ≥60 years (hazard ratio [HR]=1.45; 95% CI, 1.33-1.59) and Black race (HR=1.14; 95% CI, 1.02-1.27) were negatively associated with DSS, while female sex (HR=0.81; 95% CI, 0.72-0.90) and married status (HR=0.69; 95% CI, 0.63-0.75) were positively associated with DSS.
For patients with advanced laryngeal cancer, younger age and residing in a low-income county increase the likelihood of receiving surgical therapy. Female sex and married status provide a survival benefit, while Black race appears to be a negative prognostic factor.

If this is to be reduced there is a need for studies on not only biology and treatment approaches but also on how social factors influence cure rates. We investigated how various socioeconomic characteristics were associated with survival after childhood cancer. Material and methods In a nationwide cohort of 3797 children diagnosed with cancer [hematological cancer, central nervous system (CNS) tumors, non-CNS solid tumors] before age 20 between 1990 and 2009 we identified parents and siblings and obtained individual level parental socioeconomic variables and vital status through 2012 by linkage to population-based registries. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dying were estimated using multivariate Cox proportional hazard models. Results For all children with cancer combined, survival was slightly but not statistically significantly better the higher the education of the mother or the father, and with maternal income. Significantly better survival was observed when parents were living together compared to living alone and worse survival when the child had siblings compared to none. Young (<20) or older (≥40) maternal age showed non-significant associations, but based on small numbers. For hematological cancers, no significant associations were observed. For CNS tumors, better survival was seen with parents living together (HR 0.70, CI 0.51-0.97). For non-CNS solid tumors, survival was better with high education of the mother (HR 0.66, CI 0.44-0.99) compared to basic and worse for children with one (HR 1.45, CI 1.11-1.89) or two or more siblings (HR 1.29, CI 0.93-1.79) (p for trend 0.02) compared to none. Conclusion The impact of socioeconomic characteristics on childhood cancer survival, despite equal access to protocolled and free-of-charge treatment, warrants further and more direct studies of underlying mechanisms in order to target these as a means to improve survival rates.",Socioeconomic status may influence survival from childhood cancer.,Does survival from childhood cancer in Sweden vary by parental educational level and household income?,Nationwide cohort study of children aged 1-14 years with cancer from 1991 to 2010.,"Children of parents with lower educational levels had poorer survival, with differences observed within the first year after diagnosis.","Study conducted in Sweden, results may not apply to other countries."

It leads to a number of diseases which can be further divided into those caused by protein-caloric malnutrition and those caused by vitamin deficiencies, micronutrient, and mineral deficiencies. The purpose of this study was to identify the factors which contribute to malnutrition and to assess the dietary pattern in the pediatric population from birth up to five months belonging to poor socioeconomic areas. The children in this sample presented to a tertiary care hospital in the district of Sargodha, Pakistan. The findings in this cohort will support the development of an effective plan to tackle these issues.
This cross-sectional study was undertaken between June 2014 and December 2014 at the inpatient pediatric department of District Headquarter Hospital Sargodha. Data were collected and recorded on a predesigned form which consisted of four sections to record 1) demographics: parents' level of education, monthly income, number of dependent household members, and birth interval; 2) anthropometric and personal history, birth history, and degree of malnutrition; 3) any secondary causes of malnutrition; and 4) feeding history. The data were analyzed in SPSS v. 20. Chi-squared, phi statistics, and logistic regression analysis were run to analyze the data.
A total of 294 participants were included in the study. Logistic regression analysis showed that the degree of malnutrition was associated negatively with increasing age and positively with family size. A majority of children (144, 49%) were being breastfed for less than 5 minutes followed by 38 (13%) > 5 minutes to 15 minutes, and 2 (0.7%) > 15 minutes while 110 (37 %) infants were not breastfed.

We sought to determine whether location of care modifies the association among area income, receipt of cardiac catheterization, and mortality following an acute coronary syndrome in a universal health care system.
We studied a cohort of 14 012 acute coronary syndrome patients admitted to cardiology services between April 18, 2004, and December 31, 2011, in southern Alberta, Canada. We used multivariable logistic regression to determine the odds of cardiac catheterization within 1 day and 7 days of admission and the odds of 30-day and 1-year mortality according to area median household income quintile for patients presenting at metropolitan and nonmetropolitan hospitals. In models adjusting for area income, patients who presented at nonmetropolitan facilities had lower adjusted odds of receiving cardiac catheterization within 1 day of admission (odds ratio 0.22, 95% CI 0.11-0.46, P<0.001). Among nonmetropolitan patients, when examined by socioeconomic status, each incremental decrease in income quintile was associated with 10% lower adjusted odds of receiving cardiac catheterization within 7 days (P<0.001) and 24% higher adjusted odds of 30-day mortality (P=0.008) but no significant difference for 1-year mortality (P=0.12). There were no differences in adjusted mortality among metropolitan patients.

The Social Housing Outcomes Worth (SHOW) Study was established to assess the relationship between housing conditions and health, particularly between household crowding and infectious diseases. This paper reports on the methods and feasibility of using a large administrative housing database for epidemiological research and the characteristics of the social housing population.
This prospective open cohort study was established in 2003 in collaboration with Housing New Zealand Corporation which provides housing for approximately 5% of the population. The Study measures health outcomes using linked anonymised hospitalisation and mortality records provided by the New Zealand Ministry of Health.
It was possible to match the majority (96%) of applicant and tenant household members with their National Health Index (NHI) number allowing linkage to anonymised coded data on their hospitalisations and mortality. By December 2011, the study population consisted of 11,196 applicants and 196,612 tenants. Half were less than 21 years of age. About two-thirds identified as Māori or Pacific ethnicity. Household incomes were low. Of tenant households, 44% containing one or more smokers compared with 33% for New Zealand as a whole. Exposure to household crowding, as measured by a deficit of one or more bedrooms, was common for applicants (52%) and tenants (38%) compared with New Zealanders as whole (10%).
This project has shown that an administrative housing database can be used to form a large cohort population and successfully link cohort members to their health records in a way that meets confidentiality and ethical requirements. This study also confirms that social housing tenants are a highly deprived population with relatively low incomes and high levels of exposure to household crowding and environmental tobacco smoke.",Housing conditions can impact health outcomes.,What is the relationship between housing conditions and health outcomes in a social housing population?,Prospective cohort study in collaboration with Housing New Zealand Corporation.,Social housing tenants are a highly deprived population with exposure to household crowding and environmental tobacco smoke.,"Study focused on social housing population in New Zealand, may not be generalizable."

This retrospective cohort study used health administrative data from all residents of Ontario, Canada aged 65 to 105 with at least one of 16 chronic conditions on April 1, 2009 (n = 1,518,939). Chronic condition burden and unadjusted mortality were compared across neighborhood income quintiles. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the effect of number of chronic conditions on two-year survival across income quintiles.
Prevalence of five or more chronic conditions was significantly higher among older adults in the poorest neighborhoods (18.2%) than the wealthiest (14.3%) (Standardized difference > 0·1). There was also a socioeconomic gradient in unadjusted mortality over two years: 10.1% of people in the poorest neighborhoods died compared with 7.6% of people in the wealthiest neighborhoods. In adjusted analyses, having more chronic conditions was associated with a statistically significant increase in hazard of death over two years, however the magnitude of this effect was comparable across income quintiles. Individuals in the poorest neighborhoods with four chronic conditions had 2.07 times higher hazard of death (95% CI: 1.97-2.19) than those with one chronic condition, but this was comparable to the hazard associated with four chronic conditions in the wealthiest neighborhoods (HR: 2.29, 95% CI: 2.16-2.43).
Among older adults with universal access to health care, the deleterious effect of increasing chronic condition burden on two-year hazard of death was consistent across neighborhood income quintiles once baseline differences in condition burden were accounted for. This may be partly attributable to equal access to, and utilization of, health care. Alternate explanations for these findings, including study limitations, are also discussed.",Individuals of low socioeconomic status experience a disproportionate burden of chronic conditions.,How does chronic condition burden affect survival across socioeconomic strata?,"Retrospective cohort study using health administrative data from Ontario, Canada.","Increasing chronic condition burden associated with higher hazard of death, consistent across income quintiles.","Study focused on residents of Ontario, Canada, may not apply to other regions."

There is little knowledge, however, of their impact on wealth, human capital, economic growth or household poverty. This article estimates the risk of being poor after an NCD death in the rural, low-income area of Matlab, Bangladesh. In a matched cohort study, we estimated the 2-year relative risk (RR) of being poor in Matlab households with an NCD death in 2010. Three separate measures of household economic status were used as outcomes: an asset-based index, self-rated household economic condition and total household landholding. Several estimation methods were used including contingency tables, log-binomial regression and regression standardization and machine learning. Households with an NCD death had a large and significant risk of being poor. The unadjusted RR of being poor after death was 1.19, 1.14 and 1.10 for the asset quintile, self-rated condition and landholding outcomes. Adjusting for household and individual level independent variables with log-binomial regression gave RRs of 1.19 [standard error (SE) 0.09], 1.16 (SE 0.07) and 1.14 (SE 0.06), which were found to be exactly the same using regression standardization (SE: 0.09, 0.05, 0.03). Machine learning-based standardization produced slightly smaller RRs though still in the same order of magnitude. The findings show that efforts to address the burden of NCD may also combat household poverty and provide a return beyond improved health. Future work should attempt to disentangle the mechanisms through which economic impacts from an NCD death occur.",,,,,

Therefore, multiethnic population-based research including prospective cohorts and, when appropriate, case-control studies, is warranted. These studies should be specifically designed to ascertain key public health measures, such as geographic variations in non-communicable diseases, diagnosis of traditional and potential newly discovered risk factors, causes of death and disability, and gaps for improvement in healthcare prevention (both primary and secondary) and specific treatments. As an example, a multinational, multiethnic population-based cohort study is the Prospective Urban and Rural Epidemiology study, which is the largest global initiative of nearly 200,000 adults aged 35-70 years, looking at environmental, societal, and biological influences on obesity and chronic health conditions, such as ischemic heart disease, stroke, and cancer among urban and rural communities in low-, middle-, and high-income countries, with national, community, household, and individual-level data.

We evaluated the impact of income status on out-of-hospital prognosis in a cohort of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients, included in a countrywide study during a period of financial crisis.
The study is a secondary analysis of a prospective, multicenter, observational study-the PHAETHON study-enrolling consecutive ACS patients in 37 hospitals in Greece. Patients were classified as low or high income based on the reported net annual household income using as a cut-off point the relative poverty threshold for Greece of 12,000 Euros. The outcome measure was survival free of the primary composite endpoint (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke/transient ischemic attack, urgent revascularization and urgent hospitalization due to cardiovascular causes).
The study population included 794 patients. The administration rate of evidence-based medications was similar in the low- (n = 455) and high-income (n = 339) groups during hospitalization and upon discharge. In a median follow-up of 189 days (interquartile range: 180-212 days), low-income patients had 92 % higher risk of the combined endpoint as compared to high-income patients [Hazard ratio (HR):1.92, 95 % CI:1.25-2.94, p = 0.003]. The effect of low-income status on the combined outcome remained significant after adjustment for age, gender and depression (HR:1.59, 95 % CI:1.02-2.49; p = 0.043).

Measures of under-five mortality are typically derived from periodic household surveys collecting detailed information from women on births and child deaths. However, such surveys are expensive and are not appropriate for monitoring short-term changes in child mortality. We explored and tested the validity of two new analysis methods for less-expensive summary histories of births and child deaths for such monitoring in five African countries.
The first method we explored uses individual-level survey data on births and child deaths to impute full birth histories from an earlier survey onto summary histories from a more recent survey. The second method uses cohort changes between two surveys in the average number of children born and the number of children dead by single year of age to estimate under-five mortality for the inter-survey period. The first method produces acceptable annual estimates of under-five mortality for two out of six applications to available data sets; the second method produced an acceptable estimate in only one of five applications, though none of the applications used ideal data sets.
The methods we tested were not able to produce consistently good quality estimates of annual under-five mortality from summary birth history data. The key problem we identified was not with the methods themselves, but with the underlying quality of the summary birth histories.

We assessed the association between continuous versus intermittent water supply and waterborne diseases, child mortality, and weight for age in Hubli-Dharwad, India.
We conducted a matched cohort study with multivariate matching to identify intermittent and continuous supply areas with comparable characteristics in Hubli-Dharwad. We followed 3,922 households in 16 neighborhoods with children <5 y old, with four longitudinal visits over 15 mo (Nov 2010-Feb 2012) to record caregiver-reported health outcomes (diarrhea, highly credible gastrointestinal illness, bloody diarrhea, typhoid fever, cholera, hepatitis, and deaths of children <2 y old) and, at the final visit, to measure weight for age for children <5 y old. We also collected caregiver-reported data on negative control outcomes (cough/cold and scrapes/bruises) to assess potential bias from residual confounding or differential measurement error. Continuous supply had no significant overall association with diarrhea (prevalence ratio [PR] = 0.93, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.83-1.04, p = 0.19), bloody diarrhea (PR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.60-1.01, p = 0.06), or weight-for-age z-scores (Δz = 0.01, 95% CI: -0.07-0.09, p = 0.79) in children <5 y old. In prespecified subgroup analyses by socioeconomic status, children <5 y old in lower-income continuous supply households had 37% lower prevalence of bloody diarrhea (PR = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.46-0.87, p-value for interaction = 0.03) than lower-income intermittent supply households; in higher-income households, there was no significant association between continuous versus intermittent supply and child diarrheal illnesses. Continuous supply areas also had 42% fewer households with ≥1 reported case of typhoid fever (cumulative incidence ratio [CIR] = 0.58, 95% CI: 0.41-0.78, p = 0.001) than intermittent supply areas. There was no significant association with hepatitis, cholera, or mortality of children <2 y old; however, our results were indicative of lower mortality of children <2 y old (CIR = 0.51, 95% CI: 0.22-1.07, p = 0.10) in continuous supply areas. The major limitations of our study were the potential for unmeasured confounding given the observational design and measurement bias from differential reporting of health symptoms given the nonblinded treatment. However, there was no significant difference in the prevalence of the negative control outcomes between study groups that would suggest undetected confounding or measurement bias.
Continuous water supply had no significant overall association with diarrheal disease or ponderal growth in children <5 y old in Hubli-Dharwad; this might be due to point-of-use water contamination from continuing household storage and exposure to diarrheagenic pathogens through nonwaterborne routes. Continuous supply was associated with lower prevalence of dysentery in children in low-income households and lower typhoid fever incidence, suggesting that intermittently operated piped water systems are a significant transmission mechanism for Salmonella typhi and dysentery-causing pathogens in this urban population, despite centralized water treatment.

The independent association between income and survival following cardiac surgery is not known.
This study sought to investigate the association between household disposable income and long-term mortality after cardiac surgery.
In a Swedish nationwide population-based analysis, we included all patients who underwent cardiac surgery between 1999 and 2012 using a large national registry. Information regarding income, education, marital status, medical history, and cardiovascular risk factors was obtained from data managed by the National Board of Health and Welfare and Statistics Sweden. The adjusted risk for all-cause mortality was estimated using Cox regression by quintiles of household disposable income.
We included 100,534 patients and, during a mean follow-up of 7.3 years, 29,176 (29%) patients died. There was a stepwise inverse association between household disposable income and all-cause mortality: the adjusted hazard ratio was 0.93 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.89 to 0.96), 0.87 (95% CI: 0.84 to 0.91), 0.78 (95% CI: 0.75 to 0.82), and 0.71 (95% CI: 0.67 to 0.75), for the second, third, fourth, and fifth income quintiles, respectively, compared to the first (and lowest) income quintile. The inverse association between income and mortality was consistent through the study period and in selected subgroups, although it was slightly attenuated in older patients.
We found a strong inverse association between income and mortality following cardiac surgery in Sweden that was independent of other socioeconomic status variables, comorbidities, and cardiovascular risk profile.

The authors analyze the reasons that treatment is abandoned and attempt to provide evidence-based recommendations for improving the prognosis of medulloblastoma in this population. METHODS A total of 67 pediatric cases of newly diagnosed medulloblastoma were included in this study. All of the children were treated at Xinhua Hospital between January 2007 and June 2013. The authors retrospectively analyzed the clinical data, treatment modalities, and outcome. The male-to-female ratio was 2:1, and the patients' median age at diagnosis was 51.96 months (range 3.96-168.24 months). The median duration of follow-up was 32 months (range 3-70 months). RESULTS At the most recent follow-up date, 31 patients (46%) were alive, 30 (45%) had died, and 6 (9%) had been lost to follow-up. The estimated 3-year overall survival and progression-free survival, based on Kaplan-Meier analysis, were 55.1% ± 6.4% and 45.6% ± 6.7%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that standard-risk group (p = 0.009), postoperative radiotherapy (RT) combined with chemotherapy (p < 0.001), older age (≥ 3 years) at diagnosis (p = 0.010), gross-total resection (p = 0.012), annual family income higher than $3000 (p = 0.033), and living in urban areas (p = 0.008) were favorable prognostic factors. Multivariate analysis revealed that postoperative RT combined with chemotherapy was an independent prognostic factor (p < 0.001). The treatment abandonment rate in this cohort was 31% (21 of 67 cases). CONCLUSIONS There was a large gap between the outcome of medulloblastoma in Chinese children and the outcome in Western children. Based on our data, treatment abandonment was the major cause of therapeutic failure. Parents' misunderstanding of medulloblastoma played a major role in abandonment, followed by financial and transportation difficulties.

The goal of the present study was to investigate whether patients receiving rate-control drugs had a better prognosis compared with those without rate-control treatment.
This study used the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. There were 43 879, 18 466, and 38 898 patients with atrial fibrillation enrolled in the groups receiving β-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and digoxin, respectively. The reference group consisted of 168 678 subjects who did not receive any rate-control drug. The clinical end point was all-cause mortality. During a follow-up of 4.9±3.7 years, mortality occurred in 88 263 patients (32.7%). After adjustment for baseline differences, the risk of mortality was lower in patients receiving β-blockers (adjusted hazard ratio=0.76; 95% confidence interval=0.74-0.78) and calcium channel blockers (adjusted hazard ratio=0.93; 95% confidence interval=0.90-0.96) compared with those who did not receive rate-control medications. On the contrary, the digoxin group had a higher risk of mortality with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.12 (95% confidence interval=1.10-1.14). The results were observed consistently in subgroup analyses and among the cohorts after propensity matching.
In this nationwide atrial fibrillation cohort, the risk of mortality was lower for patients receiving rate-control treatment with β-blockers or calcium channel blockers, and the use of β-blockers was associated with the largest risk reduction. Digoxin use was associated with greater mortality.

We used data from the Cooperative Cardiovascular Project, a prospective cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized with AMI with 17 years of follow-up, to evaluate the relationship between race, area-level SES (measured by zip code-level median household income), and life expectancy after AMI. Life expectancy was estimated by using Cox proportional hazards regression with extrapolation using exponential models. Of the 141 095 patients with AMI, 6.3% were black and 6.8% resided in low-SES areas; 26% of black patients lived in low-SES areas in comparison with 5.7% of white patients. Post-myocardial infarction life expectancy estimates were shorter for black patients than for white patients across all socioeconomic levels in patients ≤ 75 years of age. After adjustment for patient and treatment characteristics, the association between race and life expectancy persisted but was attenuated.

However, to the authors' knowledge, little is known regarding the impact of nonbiological factors (NBFs) on the survival of patients with AML.
The impact of NBFs (marital status, insurance status, county-level income, and education) on survival was assessed along with biological factors (disease subtype, sex, age, and race/ethnicity) using a cohort of patients aged 19 to 64 years who were diagnosed with AML between 2007 and 2011 and reported to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program registry (SEER 18).
There were 5541 patients included. The median overall survival for the entire study population was 16 months. On multivariate analysis, an increased risk of death was independently linked to being a Medicaid beneficiary, uninsured, single, divorced, and residing in a county within the lower 3 quintiles of median household income. NBFs affected the risk of early (<2 months) and late mortality and their impact was confirmed among patients known to have received chemotherapy.

By contrast with the declining rates of injury seen in high-income countries, low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) are experiencing an increase in injury rates, largely due to increased motorisation in these countries. In this study, we report the out-of-pocket expenditure and financial risk protection from trauma care in a tertiary care hospital of India.
Patients who were admitted for at least one night in a tertiary care hospital of Chandigarh during a 1 month period from April 15, 2013, and May 15, 2013, were recruited. Data were collected for the type of injury, out-of-pocket expenditure, and mechanisms undertaken to cope up with the expenditure. Cases were followed up at 1 month, 2 months, and 12 months after discharge to collect information about out-of-pocket expenditure. Prevalence of catastrophic expenditure-ie, if it exceeded 30% of the patient's annual household income-and distress financing-ie, if borrowing (with or without interest) or selling of assets was used to cope with high out-of-pocket expenditure, were assessed among patients recruited. Assuming prevalence of catastrophic expenditure to be 22%, with a precision of 5·5% and 5% alpha error, the sample size was estimated to be 218.
227 patients were recruited, of whom 155 (68%) were followed up until 12 months. No significant differences were noted based on sociodemographic, injury, and hospitalisation characteristics between the patients who were followed up and those who were lost to follow-up. Average out-of-pocket expenditure per admission to hospital was US$388 (95% CI 332-441) and at 12 months after injury was US$1046 (871-1221). Mean out-of-pocket expenditure for road traffic injury cases at the time of hospitalisation was US$400 (95% CI 344-456) and for non-road traffic injury cases was US$369 (313-425). The prevalence of catastrophic expenditure was 30% (95% CI 26·95-33·05), which was significantly associated with lower income quartile (OR 23·3 [95% CI 5·7-93·9]; p <0·01), inpatient stay greater than 7 days (OR 8·8 [95% CI 3·8-20·6); p<0·01), major surgery (OR 4·9 [95% CI 2·2-10·8]; p<0·01), and occupation as wage labourers (OR 8·1 [95% CI 1·6-39·9]; p=0·01).

Low income was associated with worse post-operative survival in the PAD cohort (n = 324, hazard ratio 1.05, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00-1.10, per 5,000 Euro decrease) and the AAA cohort (n = 440, quadratic relation, p = .01). AAA patients in the lowest income quartile were more likely to present with a ruptured aneurysm (odds ratio [OR] 2.12, 95% CI 1.08-4.17). Lowest income quartile PAD patients presented more frequently with symptoms of critical limb ischemia, although no significant association could be established (OR 2.02, 95% CI 0.96-4.26).
The increased health hazards observed in this study are caused by patient related factors rather than differences in medical care, considering the equality of care provided by the study setting. Although the exact mechanism driving the association between SES and worse outcome remains elusive, consideration of SES as a risk factor in pre-operative decision making and focus on treatment of known SES related behavioral and psychosocial risk factors may improve the outcome of patients with vascular disease.","SES can impact outcomes in vascular surgery, but the specific effects are unclear.",How does SES influence survival and disease severity in vascular surgery patients in the Netherlands?,Retrospective cohort study using nationwide data to analyze the impact of SES on vascular surgery outcomes.,"Low SES associated with increased mortality and higher costs in vascular surgery patients, independent of clinical factors.",Need for further investigation into mechanisms driving SES disparities in vascular surgery outcomes.

We evaluated Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality PSI events within a cohort of patients with nonelective admissions. First, we identified all patients with a PSI based on day of admission (weekend versus weekday). Then, we evaluated the outcome of mortality after each PSI event. Finally, we entered age, sex, race, median household income, payer information, and Charlson comorbidity scores in regression models to develop risk ratios of weekend to weekday PSI events and mortality.
There were 28,236,749 patients evaluated with 428,685 (1.5%) experiencing one or more PSI events. The rate of PSI was the same for patients admitted on weekends as compared to weekdays (1.5%). However, the risk of mortality was 7% higher if a PSI event occurred to a patient admitted on a weekend as compared with a weekday. In addition, compared to patients admitted on weekdays, patients admitted on weekends had a 36% higher risk of postoperative wound dehiscence, 19% greater risk of death in a low-mortality diagnostic-related group, 19% increased risk of postoperative hip fracture, and 8% elevated risk of surgical inpatient death.
Risk adjusted data reveal that PSI events are substantially higher among patients admitted on weekends. The considerable differences in death after PSI events in patients admitted on weekends as compared with weekdays indicate that responses to adverse events may be less effective on weekends.","PSI events are higher among patients admitted on weekends, but the impact on mortality is unclear.",How do PSI events on weekends versus weekdays affect mortality in patients?,Analysis of PSI events and mortality in patients with nonelective admissions based on day of admission.,"Higher PSI events on weekends, with increased risk of mortality after PSI events compared to weekdays.",Observational study design.

We analyzed data from an existing cross-sectional study of 2209 participants (age ≥60 years) in a city in southeast Brazil where 92% of the population is served by a public system of primary care. Over a period of 7 years, 386 participants died and were included in the sample. We assessed the impacts that dependence on others for basic activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living, Geriatric Depression Scale scores, and health history have on mortality.
The participants' mean age was 75.2 years (SD 8.2); 51.7% of the participants were women, and 51.3% had depressive symptoms. The main causes of death were circulatory diseases (40.3%), cancer (19.8%) and respiratory diseases (13.5%). Multivariate analysis showed that, taken together, the use of more than four medications per day, smoking, lower income, older age and dependence on others for a greater number of instrumental activities of daily living predicted death in this population.

In the absence of a RCT, the use of an advanced matching procedure to reduce selection bias in large cohort studies may be the best approach. The aim of this study is to compare automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) according to peritonitis risk, technique failure and patient survival in a large nation-wide PD cohort.
This is a prospective cohort study that included all incident PD patients with at least 90 days of PD recruited in the BRAZPD study. All patients who were treated exclusively with either APD or CAPD were matched for 15 different covariates using a propensity score calculated with the nearest neighbor method. Clinical outcomes analyzed were overall mortality, technique failure and time to first peritonitis. For all analysis we also adjusted the curves for the presence of competing risks with the Fine and Gray analysis.
After the matching procedure, 2,890 patients were included in the analysis (1,445 in each group). Baseline characteristics were similar for all covariates including: age, diabetes, BMI, Center-experience, coronary artery disease, cancer, literacy, hypertension, race, previous HD, gender, pre-dialysis care, family income, peripheral artery disease and year of starting PD. Mortality rate was higher in CAPD patients (SHR1.44 CI95%1.21-1.71) compared to APD, but no difference was observed for technique failure (SHR0.83 CI95%0.69-1.02) nor for time till the first peritonitis episode (SHR0.96 CI95%0.93-1.11).
In the first large PD cohort study with groups balanced for several covariates using propensity score matching, PD modality was not associated with differences in neither time to first peritonitis nor in technique failure.

However, the effects of nonclinical factors, including insurance coverage, household income, education, type of treatment center, and area of residence, on short-term survival are less appreciated. We studied the National Cancer Data Base, a joint endeavor of the Commission on Cancer of the American College of Surgeons and the American Cancer Society, to identify disparities in 30-day mortality after lung cancer resection based on these nonclinical factors.
We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of patients undergoing lung cancer resection from 2003 to 2011 using the National Cancer Data Base. Data were analyzed using a multivariable logistic regression model to identify risk factors for 30-day mortality.
During our study period, 215,645 patients underwent lung cancer resection. We found that clinical variables, such as age, sex, comorbidity, cancer stage, preoperative radiation, extent of resection, positive surgical margins, and tumor size were associated with 30-day mortality after resection. Nonclinical factors, including living in lower-income neighborhoods with a lesser proportion of high school graduates, and receiving cancer care at a nonacademic medical center were also independently associated with increased 30-day postoperative mortality.
This study represents the largest analysis of 30-day mortality for lung cancer resection to date from a generalizable national cohort. Our results demonstrate that, in addition to known clinical risk factors, several nonclinical factors are associated with increased 30-day mortality after lung cancer resection. These disparities require additional investigation to improve lung cancer patient outcomes.","Depression is associated with worse outcomes after cardiac surgery, but the role of socioeconomic factors is unclear.",How do socioeconomic factors modify the association between preoperative depression and survival following CABG?,Nationwide cohort study in Sweden to analyze the impact of socioeconomic factors on survival after CABG.,"Preoperative antidepressant use associated with worse survival, independent of socioeconomic factors.",Need for additional research to understand the impact of depression and socioeconomic factors on postoperative mortality.

The aim was to study if socioeconomic factors modified the association between preoperative depression and survival following CABG.
In a nationwide population-based cohort study, 22,930 patients who underwent CABG in Sweden between 2006 and 2013 were included from the SWEDEHEART register. The national Prescribed Drug Register was used to ascertain preoperative antidepressant use which was utilized as a proxy for depression. Educational level, income, and civil status were extracted from the Longitudinal integration database for health insurance and labor market studies. The primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality and was ascertained from the Cause of Death register. Cox regression and propensity score methods were used to estimate the risk for death while controlling for differences in baseline characteristics.
During a mean follow-up of 4.1 years, 340 (11%) patients died in the antidepressant group and 1923 (9.7%) patients died in the control group. The adjusted risk for death was higher in patients with preoperative antidepressant use (HR 1.27; 95% CI 1.13-1.43), and was practically unchanged after the addition of educational level, family disposable income, and civil status (HR 1.25; 95% CI 1.11-1.41). The results were confirmed in a propensity-score matched cohort, and in selected subgroup analyses.
Among patients who underwent CABG in Sweden, preoperative antidepressant use was associated with worse survival even after controlling for socioeconomic factors. The clinical implication is that the impact of depression on mortality was not influenced by socioeconomic factors.","Neighborhood SES can impact outcomes in acute pulmonary embolism, but the specific effects are not well studied.",How does neighborhood SES influence mortality and treatment utilization in acute PE patients?,"Analysis of NIS data to assess the impact of neighborhood SES on in-hospital mortality, thrombolysis use, and cost in acute PE.",Lower neighborhood SES associated with increased mortality and decreased thrombolysis utilization in acute PE patients.,Need for further research on disparities in acute PE outcomes based on neighborhood SES.

We used the 2003-2011 Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) for this analysis. All hospital admissions with a principal diagnosis of acute PE were identified using ICD-9 codes. Neighborhood SES was assessed using median household income of the residential zip code for each patient. Over this 9-year period, 276,484 discharges with acute PE were analyzed. There was a progressive decrease in in-hospital mortality across the SES quartiles (p-trend <0.001). The incidence of in-hospital mortality across quartiles 1-4 was 3.8%, 3.3%, 3.2%, and 3.1%, respectively. Despite low rates of thrombolytic utilization in this cohort, we observed a progressive increase in the rate of thrombolysis utilization across the SES quartiles (1.5%, 1.6%, 1.7%, 2.0%; p-trend <0.001). There was no significant difference in the use of IVC filters across the SES quartiles (p-trend=0.9).

The objective was to investigate the ratio of cardiovascular disease mortality between hypertensives (non-treated, controlled and uncontrolled) and non-hypertensives in a cohort of a population sample of adults living in Ilha do Governador, Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil, who were classified in a survey conducted in 1991 and 1992 and whose death certificates were sought 19 years later.
A cohort study was performed on probabilistic linkage between data from an epidemiological study of hypertension performed in Ilha do Governador, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (1991 to 1992) and data from the Mortality Information System of Rio de Janeiro (1991 to 2009). The survey aimed to estimate the prevalence of hypertension and other cardiovascular risk factors in 1,270 adults aged 20 years or older selected through a probabilistic sampling of households at three economic levels (low, middle and high income). We performed a probabilistic record linkage of these databases and estimated the risk of cardiovascular death using Kaplan-Meier method to plot survival curves and Cox proportional hazards models comparing hypertensive subjects all together, and by hypertension subgroups: untreated, controlled, and uncontrolled hypertensives with non-hypertensive ones.
A total of 170 deaths occurred, of which 31.2 % attributed to cardiovascular causes. The hazard ratio for cardiovascular death was 6.1 times higher (95 % CI 2.7 - 13.7) in uncontrolled hypertensive patients relative to non-hypertensive patients. The hazard ratios for untreated hypertensive and controlled hypertensive patients were 2.7 times (95 % CI 1.1 - 6.3) and 2.1 times (95 % CI 0.38 - 11.5) higher than for normotensive patients, respectively.
The present study demonstrated a higher cardiovascular death risk among hypertensive than among non-hypertensive ones that is not associated uniquely to treatment, because uncontrolled hypertensives demonstrated a greater risk than untreated ones. Although the subgroups of hypertensive individuals were susceptible to changes in their classification over the 19 years of the study, the baseline classification was consistent with a worse prognosis in these individuals.","Hypertension is a major cardiovascular risk factor, but the impact of SES on mortality in hypertensive patients is not well understood.",How does hypertension status and neighborhood SES influence cardiovascular mortality?,Cohort study in Brazil to compare cardiovascular mortality between hypertensive and non-hypertensive individuals based on SES.,"Hypertensive patients, especially uncontrolled, have higher cardiovascular mortality risk, independent of SES.",Long-term follow-up needed to assess changes in hypertension status.

To date, however, few studies have considered how weight status in adulthood is shaped by regional variation in early-life conditions, rather than the characteristics of the individual or their family. Furthermore, gender and life course differences in the salience of early life conditions to weight status remain unclear. This study investigates whether the effect of family background and birth region on adult obesity status varies by gender and over the life course.
We used data from a population-based cohort of 6,453 adults from the Health and Retirement Study, 1992-2008. Early life conditions were measured retrospectively at and after the baseline. Obesity was calculated from self-reported height and weight. Logistic models were used to estimate the net effects of family background and birth region on adulthood obesity risk after adjusting for socioeconomic factors and health behaviors measured in adulthood. Four economic and demographic data sets were used to further test the birthplace effect.
At ages 50-61, mother's education and birth region were associated with women's obesity risk, but not men's. Each year's increase in mother's education significantly reduces the odds of being obese by 6% (OR = 0.94; 95% CI: 0.92, 0.97) among women, and this pattern persisted at ages 66-77. Women born in the Mountain region were least likely to be obese in late-middle age and late-life. Measures of per capita income and infant mortality rate in the birth region were also associated with the odds of obesity among women.

The strength of the associations may vary according to socioeconomic statuses (SES), as they determine levels of access to healthcare and psychosocial stresses. We investigated the modifying effects of SES on the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and mortality.
We used prospective cohort data of participants in the Aichi Gerontological Evaluation Study in 2003 (n=14,931), who were 65years or older and physically and cognitively independent at baseline, and residing in eight municipalities in Japan. Data on all-causes mortality and mortality from cancer, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory disease was obtained from municipal government registries.
Proportional hazard regression analyses showed that, among men, the associations between overweight (BMI≥25kg/m(2)) and higher mortality risks by any cause were stronger among lower income groups.

A higher HEI-2010 score was associated with lower risks of disease death, with adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of 0.80 (95% CI, 0.73-0.86) for all-disease mortality, 0.81 (95% CI, 0.70-0.94) for cardiovascular disease mortality, 0.81 (95% CI, 0.69-0.95) for cancer mortality, and 0.77 (95% CI, 0.67-0.88) for other disease mortality, when comparing the highest quintile with the lowest (all p-values for trend < 0.05). Similar inverse associations between HEI-2010 score and mortality were observed regardless of sex, race, and income (all p-values for interaction > 0.50). Several component scores in the HEI-2010, including whole grains, dairy, seafood and plant proteins, and ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids, showed significant inverse associations with total mortality. HEI-2005 score was also associated with lower disease mortality, with a HR of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.79-0.93) when comparing extreme quintiles. Given the observational study design, however, residual confounding cannot be completely ruled out. In addition, future studies are needed to evaluate the generalizability of these findings to African-Americans of other socioeconomic status.
Our results showed, to our knowledge for the first time, that adherence to the DGA was associated with lower total and cause-specific mortality in a low-income population, including a large proportion of African-Americans, living in the southeastern US.",Adherence to US Dietary Guidelines is linked to lower morbidity and mortality in non-Hispanic white individuals.,Is adherence to the US Dietary Guidelines associated with mortality in African-Americans and low-income populations?,"Prospective study of 84,735 American adults from low-income populations.

We assessed the impact of age stratification, socioeconomic factors, and kidney transplantation on the disparity in patient survival among African American versus non-African American patients with LN-caused ESRD, compared with other causes.
Retrospective cohort study.
Using the US Renal Data System database, we identified 12,352 patients with LN-caused ESRD among 1,132,202 patients who initiated maintenance dialysis therapy from January 1, 1995, through December 31, 2006, and were followed up until December 31, 2010.

Multivariable Cox and competing-risk regressions.
Mean duration of follow-up in the LN-caused ESRD and other-cause ESRD cohorts were 6.24±4.20 (SD) and 4.06±3.61 years, respectively. 6,106 patients with LN-caused ESRD (49.43%) and 853,762 patients with other-cause ESRD (76.24%) died during the study period (P<0.001). Patients with LN-caused ESRD were significantly younger (mean age, 39.92 years) and more likely women (81.65%) and African American (48.13%) than those with other-cause ESRD. In the fully adjusted multivariable Cox regression model, African American (vs non-African American) patients with LN-caused ESRD had significantly increased risk of death at age 18 to 30 years (adjusted HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.24-1.65) and at age 31 to 40 years (adjusted HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.02-1.34). Among patients with other-cause ESRD, African Americans were at significantly increased risk at age 18 to 30 years (adjusted HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.11-1.22).
We used zip code-based median household income as a surrogate for patient income. Residual socioeconomic confounders may exist.
African Americans are at significantly increased risk of death compared with non-African Americans with LN-caused ESRD at age 18 to 40 years, a racial disparity risk that is 10 years longer than that in the general ESRD population.

The ACTION study is a prospective, 8-country, cohort study of adult patients recruited consecutively with an initial diagnosis of cancer from public and private hospitals. Participants were interviewed at baseline and 3 months. In this paper, we identified 4,584 participants in whom surgery was indicated in initial treatment plans and assessed the following competing outcomes: death, financial catastrophe (out-of-pocket costs of >30% of annual household income), treatment discontinuation, and hospitalization without financial catastrophe incurred. We then analyzed a range of predictors using a multinomial regression model.
Of the participants, 72% were female and 44% had health insurance at baseline. At 3 months, 31% of participants incurred financial catastrophe, 8% had died, 23% had discontinued treatment, and 38% were hospitalized but avoided financial catastrophe. Health insurance status was found to be associated with lower odds of treatment discontinuation (odds ratio [OR], 0.60; 95% CI, 0.47-0.77) relative to hospitalization without financial catastrophe. Women had greater odds of financial catastrophe than men (OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.05-1.74), whereas lower socioeconomic status (range of indicators) was generally found to be associated with higher odds of death, treatment discontinuation, and financial catastrophe.

We report the effects of BCG vaccination on post-neonatal infant and post-infancy mortality in a cohort of children in Mbale, Eastern Uganda.
A community-based prospective cohort study was conducted between January 2006 and February 2014. A total of 819 eligible pregnant women were followed up for pregnancy outcomes and survival of their children up to 5 years of age. Data on the children's BCG vaccination status was collected from child health cards at multiple visits between 3 weeks and 7 years of age. Data was also collected on mothers' residence, age, parity, household income, self-reported HIV status as well as place of birth. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models taking into account potential confounders were used to estimate the association between BCG vaccination and child survival.
The neonatal mortality risk was 22 (95% CI: 13, 35), post-neonatal infant mortality 21 (12, 34) per 1,000 live births and the mortality risk among children between 1 and 5 years of age (post-infancy) was 63 (47, 82) per 1,000 live births. The median age at BCG vaccination was 4 days. Out of 819 children, 647 (79%) had received the BCG vaccine by 24 weeks of age. In the adjusted analysis, the rate of post-neonatal death among infants vaccinated with BCG tended to be nearly half of that among those who had not received the vaccine (adjusted HR: 0.47; 95% CI: 0.14, 1.53).

We used the 2003-2011 Nationwide Inpatient Sample database for this analysis. All admissions with a principal diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke were identified by using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes. SES was assessed by using median household income of the residential ZIP code for each patient. Quartile 1 and quartile 4 reflect the lowest-income and highest-income SES quartile, respectively. During a 9-year period, 775,905 discharges with acute ischemic stroke were analyzed. There was a progressive increase in the incidence of reperfusion on the first admission day across the SES quartiles (P-trend<0.001). In addition, we observed a significant reduction in discharge to nursing facility, across the SES quartiles (P-trend<0.001). Although we did not observe a significant difference in in-hospital mortality across the SES quartiles in the overall cohort (P-trend=0.22), there was a significant trend toward reduced in-hospital mortality across the SES quartiles in younger patients (<75 years) (P-trend<0.001). The mean length of stay in the lowest-income quartile was 5.75 days, which was significantly higher compared with other SES quartiles. Furthermore, the mean adjusted cost of hospitalization among quartiles 2, 3, and 4, compared with quartile 1, was significantly higher by $621, $1238, and $2577, respectively. Compared with the lowest-income quartile, there was a significantly higher use of echocardiography, invasive angiography, and operative procedures, including carotid endarterectomy, in the highest-income quartile.
Patients from lower-income quartiles had decreased reperfusion on the first admission day, compared with patients from higher-income quartiles. The cost of hospitalization of patients from higher-income quartiles was significantly higher than that of patients from lowest-income quartiles, despite longer hospital stays in the latter group.

People are free to insure themselves for small or large amounts and for short or long-terms. This freedom makes it necessary for life insurers to assess and select the mortality risks in a medical underwriting process. Medical underwriting guidelines are based on company statistics, population surveys following (clinical) epidemiological principles and clinical studies. Mortality of potential life insurance applicants is compared to life tables of insured populations, or to adjusted life tables of the general population. Because many risk determinants have higher normal values at higher ages, it is reasonably to assume that the relative hazards (RHs) or mortality ratios calculated for these risk determinants should be age dependent. This is also common use in underwriting guidelines, and can have much influence on the accessibility of life insurances for (chronically) diseased people. A proof of principle is therefor warranted.
This population-based cohort study uses NHANES- datafiles from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) and the NHANES Linked Mortality Files 2010. Only participants aged 20 to 69 that were examined in mobile examination centers, without a history of some prevalent high risk diseases were included. The observed mortality was compared to the expected mortality in a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) with Poisson error structure with two reference populations, which theoretically both can serve as preferred reference for life insurers: The United States Life Tables 2008 and the 2008 Valuation Basic Tables based on the insured population of 35 US life insurers. The age dependency was assessed of the values and the RH s of the systolic blood Pressure (SBP), aspartate aminotranseferase (ASAT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), serum albumin and albuminuria, with correction for ethnicity, household income, history of diabetes mellitus, BMI and serum cholesterol.
All 5 continuous risk determinants had age dependent values in the comparison between ages 20-54 and 55-69 (Mann-Whitney U P < 0.001). Graphical inspections using age at time of interview revealed only for the SBP an increase with age. In the GLM again only SBP had a significant interaction term with age at time of interview. It made no difference which life tables were used for the calculation of the expected mortality.
Age dependency of RHs of risk determinants can be assumed if the risk determinants themselves are age dependent on statistical and graphical inspection. In other cases age dependency might not be significant, or cannot be modelled with some form of linear function as customary in many underwriting guidelines. The RHs or mortality ratios in current medical underwriting guidelines for life insurances should be checked for age dependency by analysing the underlying data statistically and graphically and by using GLM and appropriate life tables.",Short sleep duration is prevalent in the US population and associated with increased morbidity and mortality.,What individual characteristics and behaviors are associated with short sleep duration in the US population?,"Analysis of American Time Use Survey data.

27584844,Time Dependent Relative Risks in Life Insurance Medical Underwriting,Kneepkens RF.,J Insur Med. 2015;45(2):88-97. doi: 10.17849/insm-45-02-088-097.1.,Kneepkens RF,J Insur Med,2015,2016/09/02,,,10.17849/insm-45-02-088-097.1,"Introduction .- Life insurance medicine focuses on mortality hazards in specified periods. People are free to insure their lives for shorter or longer terms. Because the chosen terms range from 1 year to a life time, life insurers have to take into account the fact that the predictive value of risk indicators can and will change over time. The time a risk indicator keeps its predictive value, will be dependent on its biological effects, volatility, and treatability. For a given applicant this implies that the relative hazard (RH) calculated for his/her medical condition should be dependent on the term of the insurance. The main objective of this study is to determine if some commonly used risk indicators - previously used to study age dependency of relative risks - have a predictive value that increases with the observation period. (1) Methods .- This population-based cohort study uses NHANES-data files from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) and the NHANES Linked Mortality Files 2010. Only participants aged 20 to 69 that were examined in mobile examination centers, without a history of some prevalent high risk diseases were included. The observed mortality was compared to the expected mortality in a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) with Poisson error structure with two reference populations, which both can serve as preferred reference for life insurers: The United States Life Tables 2008 (USLT) and the 2008 Valuation Basic Tables (VBT) based on the insured population of 35 US Life insurers. The time dependency of the RHs of the systolic blood pressure (SBP), aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), serum albumin and albuminuria, was assessed, with correction for ethnicity, household income, history of diabetes mellitus, BMI and serum cholesterol. To be able to compare the results with the results of the Age Dependency Study (ADS), the same data, risk indicators, statistical analysis method, and the Generalized Linear Model (GLM) were used. Results .- Contrary to the results in the univariate analyses, the multivariate analyses show no difference between the USLT and VBT models. In both models the RHs of SBP and albuminuria increase over time, while the RH of LDH decreases over time. Only the slopes are different, reflecting the rate of mortality increase between USLT and VBT. The RHs of ASAT and serum albumin are independent of time in both models. Discussion .- Time dependency of RHs can be assumed to exist with many risk indicators. Time dependency may take two forms: decreasing the RH and increasing the RH of a variable as time passes. Medical underwriting guidelines should therefore differentiate between short term and long term life insurances. Medical directors should realize that the presence of time dependency diminishes the value of short term clinical studies for life insurance medical underwriting. Life insurance mortality studies should always contain a discussion of the time dependency of the predictive value of the variables under study.",,,,,

In a large multi-country observational study, we examined whether exposure to HAP was associated with perinatal mortality (stillbirths from gestation week 20 and deaths through day 7 of life) as well as when the deaths occurred (macerated, non-macerated stillbirths, very early neonatal mortality (day 0-2) and later neonatal mortality (day 3-28). Questions addressing household fuel use were asked at pregnancy, delivery, and neonatal follow-up visits in a prospective cohort study of pregnant women in rural communities in five low and lower middle income countries participating in the Global Network for Women and Children's Health's Maternal and Newborn Health Registry. The study was conducted between May 2011 and October 2012. Polluting fuels included kerosene, charcoal, coal, wood, straw, crop waste and dung. Clean fuels included electricity, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), natural gas and biogas.
We studied the outcomes of 65,912 singleton pregnancies, 18 % from households using clean fuels (59 % LPG) and 82 % from households using polluting fuels (86 % wood). Compared to households cooking with clean fuels, there was an increased risk of perinatal mortality among households using polluting fuels (adjusted relative risk (aRR) 1.44, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.30-1.61). Exposure to HAP increased the risk of having a macerated stillbirth (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.66, 95%CI 1.23-2.25), non-macerated stillbirth (aOR 1.43, 95 % CI 1.15-1.85) and very early neonatal mortality (aOR 1.82, 95 % CI 1.47-2.22).
Perinatal mortality was associated with exposure to HAP from week 20 of pregnancy through at least day 2 of life. Since pregnancy losses before labor and delivery are difficult to track, the effect of exposure to polluting fuels on global perinatal mortality may have previously been underestimated.

The study population was a cross-sectional household probability sample of 248, representing 149,635 20-64 year-old residents in Piracicaba-SP, Brazil. OHRQoL was measured using the OHIP-14. Socioeconomic, demographic, health literacy, dental services use data and clinical variables were collected. Oral examinations were performed using WHO criteria for caries diagnosis, using the DMFT index; that is, the sum of decayed, missing and filled teeth (DMFT). An ordinal scale for tooth loss, based on position and number of missing teeth, was the main explanatory variable. The total OHIP score was the outcome for negative binomial regression and OHIP prevalence was the outcome for logistic regression at 5% level. A hierarchical modeling approach was adopted according to conceptual model.
OHIP score was 10.21 (SE 1.16) with 48.1% (n=115) reporting one or more impacts fairly/very often (OHIP prevalence). Significant prevalence rate ratios (PRRs) for OHIP severity were observed for those who had lost up to 12 teeth, including one or more anterior teeth (PRR=1.63, 95%CI 1.06-2.51), those who had lost 13-31 teeth (PRR=2.33, 95%CI 1.49-3.63), and the edentulous (PRR=2.66, 95%CI 1.55-4.57) compared with fully dentate adults. Other significant indicators included those who only sought dental care because of dental pain (PRR=1.67, 95%CI 1.11-2.51) or dental needs (PRR=1.84, 95%CI 1.24-2.71) and having untreated caries (PRR=1.57 95%CI 1.09-2.26). Tooth loss was not significantly associated with OHIP prevalence; instead using dental services due to dental pain (PR=2.43, 95%CI 1.01-5.82), having untreated caries (PR=3.96, 95%CI 1.85-8.51) and low income (PR=2.80, 95%CI 1.26-6.42) were significant risk indicators for reporting OHIP prevalence.
Our analyses showed OHRQoL gradients consistent with the number and position of teeth missing due to oral disease. These findings suggest that the quantity of teeth lost does not necessarily reflect the impact of tooth mortality on OHRQoL and that future studies should take this into consideration.",,,,,

Time spent traveling, which included commuting to/ from work, and immediate pre- and post-sleep activities (socializing, grooming, watching TV) were also reciprocally related to sleep duration. With every hour that work or educational training started later in the morning, sleep time increased by approximately 20 minutes. Working multiple jobs was associated with the highest odds for sleeping ≤6 hours on weekdays (adjusted OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.44; 1.81). Self-employed respondents were less likely to be short sleepers compared to private sector employees (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72; 0.95). Sociodemographic characteristics associated with paid work (age 25-64, male sex, high income, and employment per se) were consistently associated with short sleep.
U.S. population time use survey findings suggest that interventions to increase sleep time should concentrate on delaying the morning start time of work and educational activities (or making them more flexible), increasing sleep opportunities, and shortening morning and evening commute times. Reducing the need for multiple jobs may increase sleep time, but economic disincentives from working fewer hours will need to be offset. Raising awareness of the importance of sufficient sleep for health and safety may be necessary to positively influence discretionary behaviors that reduce sleep time, including television viewing and morning grooming.",,,,,

A study population included patients with RA from 2004 to 2008. The primary end point was the 5-year overall mortality rate. Individual SES was categorized into low, moderate and high levels based on the income-related insurance payment amount. Neighbourhood SES was defined by household income and neighbourhoods were grouped as an 'advantaged' area or a 'disadvantaged' area. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to compare outcomes between different SES categories. A two-sided P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Household air pollution from solid fuel use is a leading risk factor for global disease and remains a major public health problem, especially in low- and mid-income countries. This is a particularly serious problem in China, where many people in rural areas still use coal for household heating and cooking. This review focuses on several decades of research carried out in Xuanwei County, Yunnan Province, where household coal use is a major source of household air pollution and where studies have linked household air pollution exposure to high rates of lung cancer. We conducted a series of case-control and cohort studies in Xuanwei to characterize the lung cancer risk in this population and the factors associated with it. We found lung cancer risk to vary substantially between different coal types, with a higher risk associated with smoky (i.e., bituminous) coal use compared to smokeless (i.e., anthracite) coal use. The installation of a chimney in homes resulted in a substantial reduction in lung cancer incidence and mortality. Overall, our research underscores the need among existing coal users to improve ventilation, use the least toxic fuel, and eventually move toward the use of cleaner fuels, such as gas and electricity.","Household air pollution from solid fuel use is a major public health problem, especially in low- and mid-income countries.","What is the impact of household coal use on lung cancer risk in Xuanwei County, China?",Conducted case-control and cohort studies in Xuanwei County to characterize lung cancer risk associated with different coal types and interventions like chimney installation.,Smoky coal use was associated with higher lung cancer risk compared to smokeless coal.

We examined 2,761 participants with prevalent CKD stage 3 or 4 between 2003 and 2007 in the REGARDS cohort. Participants were followed through March 2013. Mortality from any cause was assessed by income and race (black or white). Low income was defined as an annual household income < $20,000, and was compared to higher incomes (≥$20,000). Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, gender, education, insurance, CKD stage, comorbidity and county-level poverty were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Prostate cancer patients treated with definitive external beam radiation therapy (EBRT)±hormone therapy from 1997 to 2006 were analyzed in this IRB-approved study. Patient demographics, treatment (Tx), and clinical outcome were obtained from electronic medical records. Median household income (mHHI) at the census block group level was obtained from the 2000 census data. Data on disease and Tx parameters included Gleason score, pre-Tx prostate-specific antigen (PSA), T stage, year of Tx, EBRT dose, and use of hormone therapy. Patients were categorized as having low-risk, intermediate-risk, or high-risk disease. Sociodemographic factors included age, race, marital status, and mHHI. Biochemical failure was defined as nadir PSA+2 ng/mL. OS was based on death from any cause.
A total of 788 consecutive patients were studied with a median follow-up of 7 years (range, 0.4 to 15 y). African Americans comprised 48% of the patients, whereas 46% of patients were white and 6% were other races. Whites had an average mHHI of $60,190 compared with $36,917 for African Americans (P<0.001). After multivariable modeling, only radiation dose was predictive for bNED (P=0.004) or OS (P=0.008). No sociodemographic factors were predictive for either outcome. Higher radiation dose predicted for better biochemical control and OS.

However, despite the recommendations of their physicians, some patients refuse these therapies. This study characterized factors associated with refusal of surgical or radiation therapy as well as the impact of refusal of recommended therapy on patients with localized malignancies.
We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program to identify a population-based sample of 925,127 patients who had diagnoses of 1 of 8 common malignancies for which surgery and/or radiation are believed to confer a survival benefit between 1995 and 2008. Refusal of oncologic therapy, as documented in the SEER database, was the primary outcome measure. Multivariable logistic regression was used to investigate factors associated with refusal. The impact of refusal of therapy on cancer-specific mortality was assessed with Fine and Gray's competing risks regression.
In total, 2441 of 692,938 patients (0.4%) refused surgery, and 2113 of 232,189 patients (0.9%) refused radiation, despite the recommendations of their physicians. On multivariable analysis, advancing age, decreasing annual income, nonwhite race, and unmarried status were associated with refusal of surgery, whereas advancing age, decreasing annual income, Asian American race, and unmarried status were associated with refusal of radiation (P<.001 in all cases).

We examine the association between short/long birth intervals and adverse neonatal outcomes by calculating and meta-analyzing associations using original data from cohort studies conducted in low-and middle-income countries (LMIC).
We identified five cohort studies. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) were calculated for each study, with birth interval as the exposure and small-for-gestational-age (SGA) and/or preterm birth, and neonatal and infant mortality as outcomes. The associations were controlled for potential confounders and meta-analyzed.
Birth interval of shorter than 18 months had statistically significant increased odds of SGA (pooled aOR: 1.51, 95% CI: 1.31-1.75), preterm (pooled aOR: 1.58, 95% CI: 1.19-2.10) and infant mortality (pooled aOR: 1.83, 95% CI: 1.19-2.81) after controlling for potential confounding factors (reference 36-<60 months). It was also significantly associated with term-SGA, preterm-appropriate-for-gestational-age, and preterm-SGA.

Birth intervals shorter than 18 months are significantly associated with SGA, preterm birth and death in the first year of life. Lack of access to family planning interventions thus contributes to the burden of adverse birth outcomes and infant mortality in LMICs.

National registers were used to identify cases of incident CVD (n = 375) and all-cause mortality (n = 385). The presence of a cash margin was determined in the questionnaire with the following question: Would you, if an unexpected situation occurred, be able to raise 10,000 SEK within a week?

Patients with a higher comorbidity index (OR 1.908, 95% CI 1.733-2.101; p < 0.001) and with complications (OR 2.214, 95% CI 1.768-2.772; p < 0.001) were more likely to have an adverse discharge disposition. Hospitals with a larger number of beds and those in the Northeast region were independent predictors of the OTR discharge disposition (p < 0.001). Admissions on weekends and nonelective admission had significant influence on the disposition (p < 0.001). Weekend and nonelective admissions were found to be independent predictors of inpatient mortality and the higher cost incurred to the hospitals (p < 0.001). High-volume and large hospitals, West region, and teaching hospitals were also the predictors of higher cost incurred to the hospitals (p < 0.001). The following variables (young patients, higher median household income, nonprivate insurance, presence of complications, and a higher comorbidity index) were significantly correlated with higher hospital charges (p < 0.001), whereas the variables young patients, nonprivate insurance, higher median household income, and higher comorbidity index independently predicted for inpatient mortality (p < 0.001).
The independent predictors of adverse discharge disposition were as follows: elderly patients, female sex, black race, lower median household income, nonprivate insurance, higher comorbidity index, presence of complications, larger hospital size, Northeast region, and weekend and nonelective admissions. The predictors of higher cost incurred to the hospitals were as follows: young patients, higher median household income, nonprivate insurance, presence of complications, higher comorbidity index, hospitals with high volume and a large number of beds, West region, teaching hospitals, and weekend and nonelective admissions.",,,,,

Even though association between SES and risky health behaviors as the main factors influencing health has been investigated in Croatian population, some questions are yet to be answered. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, smoking and excessive drinking in low, middle, and high socioeconomic group of adult Croatian population included in the cohort study on regionalism of cardiovascular health risk behaviors. We also investigated the association between SES measured by income, education and occupation, as well as single SES indicators, and risky health behaviors.
We analyzed data on 1227 adult men and women (aged 19 and older at baseline) with complete data on health behaviors, SES and chronic diseases at baseline (2003) and 5-year follow up. Respondents were classified as being healthy or chronically ill. SES categories were derived from answers to questions on monthly household income, occupation and education by using two-step cluster analysis algorithm.
At baseline, for the whole sample as well as for healthy respondents, SES was statistically significantly associated with unhealthy diet (whole sample/healthy respondents: p = 0.001), physical inactivity (whole sample/healthy respondents p = 0.44/ p = 0.007), and smoking (whole sample/healthy respondents p < 0.001/p = 0.002). The proportion of respondents with unhealthy diet was greatest in the lowest social class, smokers in the middle and physically inactive in the high social class. During the follow up, smoking and physical inactivity remained statistically significantly associated with SES. In chronically ill respondents, only smoking was statistically significantly associated with SES, at baseline and follow up (p = 0.001/p = 0.002). The highest share of smokers was in the middle social class.
Results of our study show that risky health behaviors are associated with SES and are divergently represented across socioeconomic groups of adult Croatian population. There is an obvious need for interventions targeting the specific socioeconomic group and behavior characteristic of that group.",,,,,

We recruited a cohort of 197 recent orphans and 528 non-orphans ages 9-15 and their households using stratified cluster sampling. Households were classified into three groups: orphan-only (N=50); non-orphan-only (N=377); and mixed (N=210). Between September 2004 and May 2007, households were interviewed three times regarding demographics, income and assets, and food insecurity. Baseline bivariate associations were assessed using chi-square- and t-tests. Longitudinal bivariate associations and multivariate models were tested using generalized estimating equations. At baseline, mixed households generally exhibited greater characteristics of vulnerability than orphan and non-orphan households. They were larger, had older, less educated household heads, and reported a much smaller annual per capita income. Orphan households were more likely to report a death in the previous year, and less likely to have an adult employed. These differences persisted over the study. Even non-orphan households exhibited characteristics of vulnerability, with 14% reporting a death one year before baseline, 45% of whom were prime-age adults. At baseline, a much smaller proportion of orphan households reported receiving the child support grant than the other household types, but notably, there were no differences among households in receipt of the grant by Round 3. Household food insecurity was highly prevalent: more than one in five orphan-only and mixed households reported being food insecure in the previous month. These findings suggest that the effects of HIV/AIDS only exacerbate existing high levels of poverty in the district, as virtually all households are vulnerable regardless of orphan status. Community-level programs must help families address a spectrum of needs, including food security, caregiving, and financial support, as well as better target social welfare grants and make them more accessible to vulnerable households.",,,,,

In contrast to high-income countries, the sociodemographic distribution, including socioeconomic inequalities, of NCDs and their risk factors is unclear in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly among rural populations.
We undertook a cross-sectional population-based survey of 7809 residents aged 13 years or older in the General Population Cohort in south-western rural Uganda. Information on behavioural, physiological and biochemical risk factors was obtained using standardized methods as recommended by the WHO STEPwise Approach to Surveillance. Socioeconomic status (SES) was determined by principal component analysis including household features, ownership, and occupation and education of the head of household.
SES was found to be associated with NCD risk factors in this rural population. Smoking, alcohol consumption (men only) and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were more common among those of lower SES. For example, the prevalence of smoking decreased 4-fold from the lowest to the highest SES groups, from 22.0% to 5.7% for men and 2.2% to 0.4% for women, respectively. In contrast, overweight, raised blood pressure, raised HbA1c (women only) and raised cholesterol were more common among those of higher SES. For example, the prevalence of overweight increased 5-fold from 2.1% to 10.1% for men, and 2-fold from 12.0% to 23.4% for women, from the lowest to highest SES groups respectively. However, neither low physical activity nor fruit, vegetable or staples consumption was associated with SES. Furthermore, associations between NCD risk factors and SES were modified by age and sex.
Within this rural population, NCD risk factors are common and vary both inversely and positively across the SES gradient. A better understanding of the determinants of the sociodemographic distribution of NCDs and their risk factors in rural sub-Saharan African populations will help identify populations at most risk of developing NCDs and help plan interventions to reduce their burden.","NCDs are becoming leading causes of morbidity and mortality in low- and middle-income countries, including sub-Saharan Africa.",What is the sociodemographic distribution of NCDs and their risk factors in rural sub-Saharan Africa?,Cross-sectional population-based survey of 7809 residents aged 13 years or older in rural Uganda.

METHODS A population-based cohort study was conducted with 86 mothers and newborns from two areas primary covered by the National Health System, with high rates of infant mortality in Vitória, Espírito Santo, Brazil. During 30 months, 67 (78%) children and mothers were visited seven times at home by trained interviewers, who filled out survey forms. Data on food and sucking habits, socioeconomic and maternal characteristics were collected. Variables were analyzed by Cox regression models, considering duration of breastfeeding as the dependent variable, and logistic regression (dependent variables, was the presence of a breastfeeding child in different post-natal ages). RESULTS In the logistic regression model, the pacifier sucking (adjusted Odds Ratio: 3.4; 95%CI 1.2-9.55) and bottle feeding (adjusted Odds Ratio: 4.4; 95%CI 1.6-12.1) increased the chance of weaning a child before one year of age. Variables associated to breastfeeding duration in the Cox regression model were: pacifier sucking (adjusted Hazard Ratio 2.0; 95%CI 1.2-3.3) and bottle feeding (adjusted Hazard Ratio 2.0; 95%CI 1.2-3.5). However, protective factors (maternal age and family income) differed between both models. CONCLUSIONS Risk and protective factors associated with cessation of breastfeeding may be analyzed by different models of statistical regression. Cox Regression Models are adequate to analyze such factors in longitudinal studies.

We included 24,460 men and 32,649 women aged 40 to 65 years at baseline in 35 municipalities as our study population. Primary predictors were municipal socioeconomic conditions (proportion of college graduates, per capita income, unemployment rate, and proportion of households receiving public assistance) and individual socioeconomic conditions (education level and occupation).
Among men, the multilevel logistic estimate (standard errors) of proportion of college graduates and unemployment rate for mortality from cardiovascular disease were -0.399 (0.094) and -0.343 (0.122), respectively. Among women, the multilevel logistic estimate (standard errors) of proportion of college graduates and per capita annual income for mortality from injuries were -0.386 (0.171) and -1.069 (0.407). Individual education level and occupation were associated with all-cause mortality, in particular, mortality from cardiovascular disease or injuries. Interactions between individual education level and indicators of municipal socioeconomic conditions were observed for mortality from cancer and cardiovascular disease among men and mortality from injuries among women.

Recent studies further indicate these relationships hold across generations, so that the descendants of those who grow up with many siblings are also at an apparent socioeconomic disadvantage. In this paper we add to this literature by considering whether such relationships interact with the sex and relative age of siblings. To do this we utilise a unique Swedish multigenerational birth cohort study that provides sibling configuration data on over 10,000 individuals born in 1915-1929, plus all their direct genetic descendants to the present day. Adjusting for parental and birth characteristics, we find that the 'socioeconomic cost' of growing up in a large family is independent of both the sex of siblings and the sex of the individual. However, growing up with several older as opposed to several younger siblings is predictive of relatively poor performance on school tests and a lower likelihood of progression to tertiary education. This later-born disadvantage also holds across generations, with the children of those with many older siblings achieving lower levels of educational attainment. Despite these differences, we find that while individual and descendant income is negatively related to the number of siblings, it is not influenced by the relative age of siblings. Thus, our findings imply that the educational disadvantage of later-born children, demonstrated here and in numerous other studies, does not necessarily translate into reduced earnings in adulthood. We discuss potential explanations for this pattern of results, and consider some important directions for future research into sibling configuration and wellbeing in modern societies.",Growing up with many siblings is associated with socioeconomic disadvantages.,How do relationships between growing up with many siblings and socioeconomic outcomes vary by sex and relative age of siblings?,Utilized a Swedish multigenerational birth cohort study.

All of the 727 participants (410 women, 317 men) were interviewed in their households in the period between 2001 and 2003; a structured questionnaire was used regarding their occupational activity history, which included indexes measuring particular dimensions of their psychosocial work environment based on Karasek's Job Demand-Control model and Siegrist's Effort-Reward Imbalance model, as well as health-related quality of life and demographic data. Mortality was ascertained by monitoring City Vital Records for 7 years. Analyses were conducted separately for men and women, with the multivariate Cox proportional hazard model.
During a 7-year follow-up period, 59 participants (8.1%) died, including 21 women (5.1% of total women) and 38 men (12%) (p < 0.05). Significant differences in the number of deaths occurred regarding disproportion between physical demands and control in men: those with low physical demands and low control died three times more often than those with high control, regardless of the level of demands. The multivariate Cox proportional hazard model showed that significantly higher risk of death was observed only in men with low physical demands and low control, compared to those with low physical demands and high control (Exp(B) = 4.65, 95% CI: 1.64-13.2).

A total of 5365 patients who were new statin users between December 1, 2006, and November 30, 2007; 2674 patients were in the adherent group and 2691 were in the nonadherent group.
Adherence was determined by the medication possession ratio. Patients were categorized as adherent if the medication possession ratio at follow-up was 0.80 or more. Adherent patients exhibited significant differences in baseline demographic and clinical characteristics than nonadherent patients in our study sample. Baseline laboratory values for adherent patients were significantly lower for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL), and total cholesterol levels. The primary outcome was change in LDL level from baseline at 12 months. Secondary outcomes were changes in non-HDL and total cholesterol levels from baseline at 12 months. Independent variables controlled for in the multiple linear regression included age, sex, body mass index, race-ethnicity, baseline lipid panel (LDL, HDL, total cholesterol, and triglycerides), statin copayment status, income quintile (according to ZIP code median household income), baseline medication count, statin prescribed, and comorbidities. Multiple linear regression revealed that adherent patients demonstrated significantly greater reductions in LDL of 20.98 mg/dl versus nonadherent patients (p<0.0001).

More than 500,000 adults were followed for 22 years between 1982 and 2004. Tax records provided information on sex, income, marital status and postal code while a linkage was used to determine vital status. Cox models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) for quintiles of neighbourhood material and social deprivation.
There were 180,000 deaths over the follow-up period. In unadjusted analyses, those living in the most materially deprived neighbourhoods had elevated risks of mortality (HR(males) 1.37, 95% CI: 1.33-1.41; HR(females) 1.20, 95% CI: 1.16-1.24) when compared with those living in the least deprived neighbourhoods. Mortality risk was also elevated for those living in socially deprived neighbourhoods (HR(males) 1.15, CI: 1.12-1.18; HR(females) 1.15, CI: 1.12-1.19). Mortality risk associated with material deprivation remained elevated in models that adjusted for individual factors (HR(males) 1.20, CI: 1.17-1.24; HR(females) 1.16, CI: 1.13-1.20) and this was also the case for social deprivation (HR(males) 1.12, CI: 1.09-1.15; HR(females) 1.09, CI: 1.05-1.12). Immigrant neighbourhoods were protective of mortality risk for both sexes. Being poor and living in the most socially advantageous neighbourhoods translated into a survival gap of 10% over those in the most socially deprived neighbourhoods.

International experience shows that improved economic conditions in a country can reduce the risk of perinatal mortality, decrease the risk of low birth weight and increase the mean birth weight in newborns. The Health and Demographic Surveillance Site (HDSS) FilaBavi in Bavi district outside Hanoi city has been operational since 1999. An open cohort of more than 12,000 households (52,000 persons) has been followed primarily with respect to demography, economy and education. The aim of this research is to study trends in birth weight as well as birth and delivery practices over the time period 1999-2010 in FilaBavi in relation to the social and economic development.
Information about birth weight, sex, place and method of delivery, mother's age and education as well as household economy of 10,114 children, born from 1999 to 2010, was obtained from the routine data collection in the HDSS.
Over the study period the mean birth weight remained at the same level, about 3,100 g, in spite of increased economic resources and technology development. At the individual child level we found associations between birth weight and household economy as well as the education of the mother. Hospital delivery increased from about 35% to 65% and the use of Caesarian section increased from 2.6% to 10.1%.
During the twelve years studied, household income as well as the use of modern technology increased rapidly. In spite of that, the mean and variation of birth weight did not change systematically. It is suggested that increasing gaps in economic conditions and misallocation of resources, possibly to overuse of technology, are partly responsible.","Economic conditions in Vietnam have improved, but birth weight trends have not changed.",How have birth weight trends and delivery practices changed over time in relation to social and economic development in Vietnam?,"Longitudinal study in Vietnam.

Little has been published about stroke in Peru. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of hospitalized stroke patients at a referral center hospital in Lima, Peru to explore factors associated with functional outcome among stroke patients.
We identified 579 patients hospitalized for ischemic stroke or intracerebral hemorrhage stroke at the National Institute of Neurologic Sciences in Lima, Peru in 2008 and 2009. A favorable outcome was defined as a modified Rankin scale score of ≤ 2 at discharge.
The mean age was 63.3 years; 75.6% had ischemic stroke; the average duration of stay was 17.3 days. At hospital discharge, 231 (39.9%) had a favorable outcome. The overall mortality rate was 5.2%. In multivariate models, the likelihood of having a favorable outcome decreased linearly with increasing age (P = .02) and increasing National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score (P = .02). Favorable outcome was also associated with male gender (relative risk [RR] 1.2; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0-1.5) and divorced status (RR 1.3; 95% CI 1.1-1.7). Patients on Salud Integral de Salud (SIS; public assistance-type insurance; RR 0.7; 95% CI 0.5-1.0) were also less likely to have a favorable outcome.
Favorable outcome after stroke was independently associated with younger age, a lower NIHSS score, male gender, being divorced, and not being on SIS insurance. These findings suggest that additional study of worse functional outcomes in patients with SIS insurance be conducted and confirm the importance of risk adjustment for age, stroke severity (according to the NIHSS scale), and other socioeconomic factors in outcomes studies.

The data were drawn from a 10-year longitudinal study (2000-2010) that followed a probabilistic and representative sample of the SABE (Health, Welfare and Aging) cohort. The present study was based on 78% (1019) of the baseline sample of adults aged 60 years or more living in Santiago, Chile. Functional limitation was defined on the basis of a combination of six basic activities of daily living, seven instrumental activities, and seven mobility activities (limited, no limited). Socioeconomic position (high, medium and low) was assessed by combining measures of household equipment, wealth, and education.
The initial prevalence of functional limitation was 47.3% (95%CI: 44.2-50.4) with a clear socioeconomic gradient (60.1% low, 47.5% medium, and 28.7% high; p<0.001). At the end of the follow-up, older adults with low socioeconomic status remained functionally limited while those with high socioeconomic status remained non-limited. The incidence density of functional limitation also followed a socioeconomic gradient (5.33, 6.59 and 7.73 per 100 years-person for low, medium and high socioeconomic status). Social inequalities were also observed for mortality.
This study corroborates the social stratification of functional status and mortality, suggesting that aging is not a leveler of inequalities.

This is a retrospective cohort study from 2009 to 2010 of all 1,053,101 hospitalizations at 42 tertiary care, freestanding children's hospitals. The main exposure was SES, determined by the median annual household income for the patient's ZIP code. The main outcome measure was death during the admission. Primary outcomes of interest were stratified by income and diagnosis-based service lines. Observed-to-expected mortality ratios were created, and trends across quartiles of SES were examined.
Death occurred in 8950 (0.84%) of the hospitalizations. Overall, mortality rates were associated with SES (P < .0001) and followed an inverse linear association (P < .0001). Similarly, observed-to-expected mortality was associated with SES in an inverse association (P = .014). However, mortality overall was less than expected for all income quartiles (P < .05). The association of SES and mortality varied by service line; only 3 service lines (cardiac, gastrointestinal, and neonatal) demonstrated an inverse association between SES and observed-to-expected mortality.
Within children's hospitals, SES is inversely associated with in-hospital mortality, but is lower than expected for even the lowest SES quartile.

Cardiopulmonary death rate was 6.2 per 1,000 PYs in the solid-fuel group and 5.3 per 1,000 PYs in people living in households using gas. Mortality due to cardiovascular event was 5.1 and 4.8 per 1,000 PY in people from the solid-fuel and gas-supplied households, respectively, and the incident rate ratio was 1.07 (95% CI: 0.82 to 1.41). Mortality due to respiratory disease was 1.2 and 0.5 per 1,000 PYs in the solid-fuel and gas-supplied groups, respectively, and the incident rate ratio was 2.26 (95% CI: 1.02 to 4.99).

Rapid administration of antibiotics when fever develops can prevent progression to sepsis and shock, and serves as an important indicator of the quality of care in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia. We analyzed factors associated with (1) Longer times from fever onset to hospital presentation/antibiotic treatment and (2) Sepsis and infection-related mortality.
This prospective cohort study included children aged 0-16 years with newly diagnosed acute leukemia treated at Benjamin Bloom Hospital, San Salvador. We interviewed parents/caregivers within one month of diagnosis and at the onset of each new febrile episode. Times from initial fever to first antibiotic administration and occurrence of sepsis and infection-related mortality were documented.
Of 251 children enrolled, 215 had acute lymphoblastic leukemia (85.7%). Among 269 outpatient febrile episodes, median times from fever to deciding to seek medical care was 10.0 hours (interquartile range [IQR] 5.0-20.0), and from decision to seek care to first hospital visit was 1.8 hours (IQR 1.0-3.0). Forty-seven (17.5%) patients developed sepsis and 7 (2.6%) died of infection. Maternal illiteracy was associated with longer time from fever to decision to seek care (P = 0.029) and sepsis (odds ratio [OR] 3.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09-8.63; P = 0.034).

We retrospectively analyzed the records of 660 women initially treated from 1985 to 2009. On the basis of income data obtained from the 2000 US census, patients were separated into various income groups (halves, tertiles, and quartiles) based on median household income, with most focus on the half income groups.
Income groups were similar regarding treatments received and characteristics, with the exception of more African American (AA), unmarried patients, and a predilection for higher grade in the lower half income group (LHIG). Compared with the upper half income group (UHIG), the LHIG had lower disease-specific survival (DSS) (5 y: 93.9% vs. 97.0% and 10 y: 90.1% vs. 95.9%; P=0.023) and a trend toward lower overall survival (OS) (5 y: 83.4% vs. 86.5% and 10 y: 62.6% vs. 68.5%; P=0.067). In patients with higher-risk features, differences in outcomes between LHIG and UHIG were more pronounced; 10-year OS of 43.4% versus 60.2% (P=0.004) and 10-year DSS of 75.0% versus 93.0% (P=0.007), respectively. Regarding race, AA patients in the LHIG had lower OS than AA in the UHIG.

We examined whether income disparities in diabetes-related morbidity or mortality decline after age 65 in a setting where much of health care is publicly funded yet universal drug coverage starts only at age 65.
We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study using administrative health claims from Ontario, Canada. Adults with diabetes (N = 606,051) were followed from 1 April 2002 to 31 March 2008 for a composite outcome of death, nonfatal acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and nonfatal stroke. SES was based on neighborhood median household income levels from the 2001 Canadian Census.
SES was a strong predictor of death, nonfatal AMI, or nonfatal stroke among those <65 years of age (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.51 [95% CI 1.45-1.56]) and exerted a lesser effect among those ≥65 years of age (1.12 [1.09-1.14]; P < 0.0001 for interaction), after adjusting for age, sex, baseline cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes duration, comorbidity, and health care utilization. SES gradients were consistent for all groups <65 years of age. Similar findings were noted for 1-year post-AMI mortality (<65 years of age, 1.33 [1.09-1.63]; ≥65 years of age, 1.09 [1.01-1.18]).

CBAS workers provide adherence and psychosocial support for patients and undertake home visits to address household challenges affecting adherence. An observational multicohort study of adults enrolling for ART between 2004 and 2010 was performed. Mortality, loss to follow-up, and virological suppression were compared by intention to treat between patients who received and did not receive CBAS until 5 years of ART, using multiple imputation of missing covariate values.
Of the 66,953 patients who were included, 19,668 (29.4%) patients received CBAS and 47,285 (70.6%) patients did not. Complete-case covariate data were available for 54.3% patients.

Prospective cohort study in three hospitals in Maryland representing different demographics between 1993 and 2007.
Patients with an incident admission who were either white or black, and had either private insurance, state-based insurance or were uninsured. 4,908 patients were diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction, 6,759 with coronary atherosclerosis, and 1,293 with stroke.
Demographic and clinical patient-level data were collected from an administrative billing database and neighborhood household income was collected from the 2000 US Census. The outcome of all-cause mortality was collected from the Social Security Death Master File.
In an analysis adjusted for race, disease severity, location, neighborhood household income among other confounders, being underinsured was associated with an increased risk of death after myocardial infarction (relative hazard, 1.31 [95 % CI: 1.09, 1.59]), coronary atherosclerosis (relative hazard, 1.50 [95 % CI: 1.26, 1.80]) or stroke (relative hazard, 1.25 [95 % CI: 0.91, 1.72]).

Neighbourhoods of 50 households with overlapping boundaries were defined using Census 2000 and road network data. Median rent per square metre, proportion households headed by a person with primary education or less, proportion headed by a person in manual or unskilled occupation and the mean number of persons per room were analysed in principle component analysis. The authors compared the index with independent income data and examined associations with mortality from 2001 to 2008.
1.27 million overlapping neighbourhoods were defined. Education, occupation and housing variables had loadings of 0.578, 0.570 and 0.362, respectively, and median rent had a loading of -0.459. Mean yearly equivalised income of households increased from SFr42 000 to SFr72 000 between deciles of neighbourhoods with lowest and highest SEP.

Adult ART programmes have demonstrated benefit from community support to improve treatment outcomes; however, there are no empirical data on the effectiveness of this intervention in children. This study compared clinical, virological and immunological outcomes between children who received and who did not receive community-based adherence support from patient advocates (PAs) in four South African provinces.
A multicentre cohort study of ART-naïve children was conducted at 47 public ART facilities. Outcome measures were mortality, patient retention, virological suppression and CD4 percentage changes on ART. PAs are lay community health workers who provide adherence and psychosocial support for children's caregivers, and they undertake home visits to ascertain household challenges potentially impacting on adherence in the child. Corrected mortality estimates were calculated, correcting for deaths amongst those lost to follow-up (LTFU) using probability-weighted Kaplan-Meier and Cox functions.
Three thousand five hundred and sixty three children were included with a median baseline age of 6.3 years and a median baseline CD4 cell percentage of 12.0%. PA-supported children numbered 323 (9.1%). Baseline clinical status variables were equivalent between the two groups. Amongst children LTFU, 38.7% were known to have died. Patient retention after 3 years of ART was 91.5% (95% CI: 86.8% to 94.7%) vs. 85.6% (95% CI: 83.3% to 87.6%) amongst children with and without PAs, respectively (p = 0.027). Amongst children aged below 2 years at baseline, retention after 3 years was 92.2% (95% CI: 76.7% to 97.6%) vs. 74.2% (95% CI: 65.4% to 81.0%) in children with and without PAs, respectively (p = 0.053). Corrected mortality after 3 years of ART was 3.7% (95% CI: 1.9% to 7.4%) vs. 8.0% (95% CI: 6.5% to 9.8%) amongst children with and without PAs, respectively (p = 0.060). In multivariable analyses, children with PAs had reduced probabilities of both attrition and mortality, adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) 0.57 (95% CI: 0.35 to 0.94) and 0.39 (95% CI: 0.15 to 1.04), respectively.

We assessed incidence of dementia according to criteria from the 10/66 Dementia Research Group and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) IV, the effect of dementia at baseline on mortality, and the independent effects of age, sex, socioeconomic position, and indicators of cognitive reserve.
We did a population-based cohort study of all people aged 65 years and older living in urban sites in Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Venezuela, and rural and urban sites in Peru, Mexico, and China, with ascertainment of incident 10/66 and DSM-IV dementia 3-5 years after cohort inception. We used questionnaires to obtain information about age in years, sex, educational level, literacy, occupational attainment, and number of household assets. We obtained information about mortality from all sites. For participants who had died, we interviewed a friend or relative to ascertain the likelihood that they had dementia before death.
12,887 participants were interviewed at baseline. 11,718 were free of dementia, of whom 8137 (69%) were reinterviewed, contributing 34,718 person-years of follow-up. Incidence for 10/66 dementia varied between 18·2 and 30·4 per 1000 person-years, and were 1·4-2·7 times higher than were those for DSM-IV dementia (9·9-15·7 per 1000 person-years). Mortality hazards were 1·56-5·69 times higher in individuals with dementia at baseline than in those who were dementia-free. Informant reports suggested a high incidence of dementia before death; overall incidence might be 4-19% higher if these data were included. 10/66 dementia incidence was independently associated with increased age (HR 1·67; 95% CI 1·56-1·79), female sex (0·72; 0·61-0·84), and low education (0·89; 0·81-0·97), but not with occupational attainment (1·04; 0·95-1·13).
Our results provide supportive evidence for the cognitive reserve hypothesis, showing that in middle-income countries as in high-income countries, education, literacy, verbal fluency, and motor sequencing confer substantial protection against the onset of dementia.

Screening with colonoscopy, the most commonly used test in the US, has been shown to reduce the risk of death from CRC. This study examined if, among insured persons receiving care in integrated healthcare delivery systems, differences exist in colonoscopy use according to neighborhood SES.
We assembled a retrospective cohort of 100,566 men and women, 50-74 years old, who had been enrolled in one of three US health plans for ≥1 year on January 1, 2000. Subjects were followed until the date of first colonoscopy, date of disenrollment from the health plan, or December 31, 2007, whichever occurred first. We obtained data on colonoscopy use from administrative records. We defined screening colonoscopy as an examination that was not preceded by gastrointestinal conditions in the prior 6-month period. Neighborhood SES was measured using the percentage of households in each subject's census-tract with an income below 1999 federal poverty levels based on 2000 US census data. Analyses, adjusted for demographics and comorbidity index, were performed using Weibull regression models.
The average age of the cohort was 60 years and 52.7% were female. During 449,738 person-years of follow-up, fewer subjects in the lowest SES quartile (Q1) compared to the highest quartile (Q4) had any colonoscopy (26.7% vs. 37.1%) or a screening colonoscopy (7.6% vs. 13.3%). In regression analyses, compared to Q4, subjects in Q1 were 16% (adjusted HR = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.80-0.88) less likely to undergo any colonoscopy and 30%(adjusted HR = 0.70, CI: 0.65-0.75) less likely to undergo a screening colonoscopy.
People in lower-SES neighborhoods are less likely to undergo a colonoscopy, even among insured subjects receiving care in integrated healthcare systems. Removing health insurance barriers alone is unlikely to eliminate disparities in colonoscopy use.",,,,,

We investigated the association between distance from residence and major roadway and 10-year all-cause mortality after AMI in the Determinants of Myocardial Infarction Onset Study (Onset Study), hypothesizing that living closer to a major roadway at the time of AMI would be associated with increased risk of mortality.
The Onset Study enrolled 3886 individuals hospitalized for AMI in 64 centers across the United States from 1989 to 1996. Institutionalized patients, those providing only post office boxes, and those whose addresses could not be geocoded were excluded, leaving 3547 patients eligible for analysis. Addresses were geocoded, and distance to the nearest major roadway was assigned. Cox regression was used to calculate hazard ratios, with adjustment for personal characteristics (age, sex, race, education, marital status, distance to nearest acute care hospital), clinical characteristics (smoking, body mass index, comorbidities, medications), and neighborhood-level characteristics derived from US Census block group data (household income, education, urbanicity). There were 1071 deaths after 10 years of follow-up. In the fully adjusted model, compared with living >1000 m, hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) for living ≤100 m were 1.27 (1.01-1.60), for 100 to ≤200 m were 1.19 (0.93-1.60), and for 200 to ≤1000 m were 1.13 (0.99-1.30) (P(trend)=0.016).

Prospective cohort study.
A total of 20 federally funded SCI Model Systems of care in the United States.
Participants included 7955 adults with traumatic SCI. Preliminary assessments were conducted between 1995 and 2006. Mortality status was determined by the Social Security Death Index (1308 deaths). A two-stage logistic regression model was used to estimate the chance of dying in any given year. Life expectancy was calculated under different economic assumptions.
Compared with those who were working 30+ h per week, the odds of mortality was 1.37 for those who worked 1-29 h and 1.67 for those who were unemployed. The addition of gainful employment only modestly reduced the effects of household income and education, both of which remained significant. For instance, the odds of mortality for household income (referent $75 000+) decreased from 1.50 to 1.38 for $25 000-$75 000 and from 2.10 to 1.82 for < $25 000. Life expectancy varied widely depending on socioeconomic characteristics more than doubling under certain assumptions.
Substantial variation in mortality is attributable to employment, above and beyond the effects of previously established demographic, injury and socioeconomic predictors. Although some excess mortality may be the inevitable consequence of SCI, risk is substantially increased with poor socioeconomic characteristics.",,,,,

In a national register-based controlled cohort study from Norway, 1,548 women diagnosed with breast cancer (all stages) between 1992 and 1996 at the age 45-54 years and 1,548 cancer-free women matched for age, municipality and civil status were followed for up to 14 years. Medical data from the Cancer Registry of Norway were linked with longitudinal data on employment, social security benefits and socio-demography collected from other national official registries.
Compared to cancer-free controls, breast cancer patients were significantly more likely to receive disability pension (hazard ratio (HR) 2.7, 95% CI 2.3-3.2) after adjustment for unmatched socio-demographic variables (education, income and children <18 years in the household). Adjusted HR in breast cancer stage I patients was 1.8 (95% CI 1.5-2.3) and 3.0 (95% CI 2.4-3.8) in stage II/III patients compared to controls. The risk increased with mastectomy compared to breast-conserving surgery (HR 1.5, 95% CI 1.2-1.9). At the end of the observation period, employment rates were higher in non-disabled patients than in non-disabled controls (82% vs. 77%, p = 0.008). Working breast cancer patients experienced a temporary negative effect on employment income.
A considerable proportion of women with breast cancer will over time experience permanently reduced work ability and become disability pension holders. In case of reduced work ability in breast cancer survivors, medical personel caring for them should consider and discuss with them rehabilitation and workplace adjustment in order to prevent early disability pension.",,,,,

The objective of this study was to clearly elucidate the association between SES, education, and clinical outcomes among patients with NSCLC.
The study population was derived from a consecutive, retrospective cohort of patients with NSCLC who received treatment within the Duke Health System between 1995 and 2007. SES determinants were based on the individual's census tract and corresponding 2000 Census data. Determinants included the percentage of the population living below poverty, the median household income, and the percentages of residents with at least a high school diploma and at least a bachelor's degree. The SES and educational variables were divided into quartiles. Statistical comparisons were performed using the 25th and 75th percentiles.
Individuals who resided in areas with a low median household income or in which a high percentage of residents were living below the poverty line had a shorter cancer-specific 6-year survival than individuals who resided in converse areas (P = .0167 and P = .0067, respectively). Those living in areas in which a higher percentage of residents achieved a high school diploma had improved disease outcomes compared with those living in areas in which a lower percentage attained a high school diploma (P = .0033). A survival advantage also was observed for inhabitants of areas in which a higher percentage of residents attained a bachelor's degree (P = .0455).
Low SES was identified as an independent prognostic factor for poor survival in patients with both early and advanced stage NSCLC. Patients who lived in areas with high poverty levels, low median incomes, and low education levels had worse mortality.",,,,,

To identify risk factors for the above in order to improve strategies for case management and to develop appropriate public health messages.
All children under 5 years of age admitted to the Special Care Ward, Dhaka Hospital of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research (ICDDR,B) from 1 September to 31 December 2007 were considered for enrollment if they also had diarrhoea. Of the 258 children with diarrhoea enrolled, those with (n=198) or without (n=60) WHO-defined pneumonia constituted the pneumonia and comparison groups, respectively. Among the 198 children with pneumonia, children who survived (n=174) were compared with those who died in hospital (n=24).
After adjusting for socio-demographic factors, including low levels of literacy of either parent, low household income, not having a window or exhaust fan in the kitchen, household smoking and over-crowding, children with pneumonia were more likely to sleep on a bare wooden-slatted or bamboo bed (OR 2·7, 95% CI 1·40-5·21, p = 0·003) than on other bedding, and were also more likely to have a parent/care-giver with poor knowledge of pneumonia (OR 1·94, 95% CI 1·02-3·70, p=0·043). Independent risk factors for death include severe underweight (OR 5·2, 95% CI 1·2-22·0, p=0·03), hypoxaemia (OR 17·5, 95% CI I 1·9-160·0, p=0·01), severe sepsis (OR 8·7, 95% CI I 1·8-41·5, p=0·007) and lobar consolidation (OR 11·9, 95% CI 2·3-61·6, p=0·003).
Increased public awareness of signs of pneumonia and severe sepsis in children under 5 is important to mitigate the risks of pneumonia and pneumonia-related deaths, and the importance of appropriate bedding for young children in reducing the risk of pneumonia needs to be addressed.",,,,,

Studies have found that biomass cooking fuels are an important risk factor for ALRI. However, few studies have evaluated the influence of natural household ventilation indicators on ALRI. The purpose of this study was to assess the association between cooking fuel, natural household ventilation, and ALRI. During October 17, 2004-September 30, 2005, children <5 years living in a low-income neighborhood of Dhaka, Bangladesh, were assessed weekly for ALRI and surveyed quarterly about biomass fuel use, electric fan ownership, and natural household ventilation (windows, ventilation grates, and presence of a gap between the wall and ceiling). Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed using generalized estimating equations. Six thousand and seventy-nine children <5 years enrolled during the study period (99% participation) experienced 1291 ALRI. In the multivariate model, ≥2 windows [OR = 0.75, 95% CI = (0.58, 0.96)], ventilation grates [OR = 0.80, 95% CI = (0.65, 0.98)], and not owning an electric fan [OR = 1.50, 95% CI = (1.21, 1.88)] were associated with ALRI; gap presence and using biomass fuels were not associated with ALRI. Structural factors that might improve household air circulation and exchange were associated with decreased ALRI risk. Improved natural ventilation might reduce ALRI among children in low-income families.
The World Health Organization has stated that controlling pneumonia is a priority for achieving the fourth Millennium Development Goal, which calls for a two-third reduction in mortality of children <5 years old compared to the 1990 baseline. Our study represents an important finding of a modifiable risk factor that might decrease the burden of respiratory illness among children living in Bangladesh and other low-income settings similar to our study site. We found that the existence of at least two windows in the child's sleeping room was associated with a 25% decreased ALRI risk. Increasing available natural ventilation within the household in similar settings has the potential to reduce childhood mortality because of acute lower respiratory illnesses.",,,,,

In this study, data drawn from the 1970 longitudinal British cohort study were analysed to determine whether extended family support encourages fertility in contemporary Britain. The results showed that at age 30, reported frequency that participants saw their own parents (but not in-laws) and the closeness of the bond between the participant and their own parents were associated with an increased likelihood of having a child between ages 30 and 34. Financial help and reported grandparental childcare were not significantly positively associated with births from age 30 to 34. Men's income was positively associated with likelihood of birth, whereas women's income increased likelihood of birth only for working women with at least one child. While it was predicted that grandparental financial and childcare help would increase the likelihood of reproduction by lowering the cost to the parent of having a child, it appears that the mere physical presence of supportive parents rather than their financial or childcare help encouraged reproduction in the 1970 British birth cohort sample.",,,,,

Other studies have demonstrated disparities in race and socioeconomic status (SES) in breast cancer survival. The purpose of our study was to determine whether nonwhite or low-SES patients are disproportionately treated in low-volume hospitals.
A population-based cohort of 2,777 Medicare breast cancer patients who underwent breast cancer surgery in 2003 participated in a survey study examining breast cancer outcomes. Information was obtained from survey responses, Medicare claims, and state tumor registry data.
On univariate analysis, patients treated at low-volume hospitals were less likely to be white, less likely to live in an urban location, and more likely to have a low SES with less social support and live a greater distance from a high-volume hospital. Education, marital status, total household income, having additional insurance besides Medicare, population density of primary residence, and tangible support were associated with distance to the nearest high-volume hospital. On multivariate analysis, the independent predictors of treatment at a low-volume hospital were being nonwhite (P = 0.003), having a lower household income (P < 0.0001), residence in a rural location (P = 0.01), and living a greater distance from a high-volume hospital (P < 0.0001).
In this large population-based cohort, women who were poorer, nonwhite, and who lived in a rural location or at a greater distance from a high-volume hospital were more likely to be treated at low-volume hospitals. These differences may partially explain racial and SES disparities in breast cancer outcomes.",,,,,

Using the 1991-2001 Canadian Census Mortality Follow-up Study cohort (N = 2,685,400), measures of individual social (civil status, family structure, living alone) and material (education, income, employment) disadvantage were entered into Cox proportional hazard models to calculate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for male and female suicide mortality. Two indices of area deprivation were computed - one capturing social, and the other material, dimensions - and models were run separately for high versus low deprivation.
After accounting for individual and area characteristics, individual social and material disadvantage were associated with higher suicide mortality, especially for individuals not employed, not married, with low education and low income. Associations between social and material area deprivation and suicide mortality largely disappeared upon adjustment for individual-level disadvantage. In stratified analyses, suicide risk was greater for low income females in socially deprived areas and males living alone in materially deprived areas, and there was no evidence of other modifying effects of area deprivation.
Individual disadvantage was associated with suicide mortality, particularly for males. With some exceptions, there was little evidence that area deprivation modified the influence of individual disadvantage on suicide risk.

Growth curve analysis of seven cycles of the Canadian National Population Health Survey (n=13,682) for adults aged 20 and older at baseline (1994/95). The outcome of interest is the Health Utilities Index Mark 3, a measure of health-related quality of life (HRQL). Models include the deceased so as not to present overly optimistic HRQL values. Socio-economic position is measured separately by household-size-adjusted income and highest level of education attained.
HRQL is consistently highest for the most affluent and the most highly educated men and women, and is lower, in turn, for middle and lower income and education groups. HRQL declines with age for both men and women. The rate of the decline in HRQL, however, was related neither to income nor to education for men, suggesting stability in the social gradient in HRQL over time for men. There was a sharper decline in HRQL for upper-middle and highest-income groups for women than for the poorest women.
HRQL is graded by both income and education in Canadian men and women. The grading of HRQL by social position appears to be 'set' in early adulthood and is stable through mid- and later life.",Socio-economic position influences health-related quality of life.,How does socio-economic position affect health-related quality of life over time?,"Analysis of Canadian National Population Health Survey data for adults aged 20 and older, assessing socio-economic position and health-related quality of life.","HRQL was highest for the most affluent and highly educated individuals, declining with age.

We assessed the association of neighborhood median household income (nINC) and Medicaid status with rehospitalization or death in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities cohort study (1987 to 2004) after an incident HF hospitalization in the context of individual socioeconomic status and evaluated the relationship for modification by demographic and comorbidity factors. We used generalized linear Poisson mixed models to estimate rehospitalization rate ratios and 95% CIs and Cox regression to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs of rehospitalization or death. In models controlling for race and study community, sex, age at HF diagnosis, body mass index, hypertension, educational attainment, alcohol use, and smoking, patients with a high burden of comorbidity who were living in low-nINC areas at baseline had an elevated hazard of all-cause rehospitalization (HR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.10 to 1.77), death (HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.80), and rehospitalization or death (HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.70) as well as increased rates of hospitalization compared to those with a high burden of comorbidity living in high-nINC areas.

However, very few studies have examined individual-level SES in relation to breast cancer survival or have assessed the contextual role of community-level SES independent of individual-level SES.
The authors of this report examined both individual-level and community-level SES in relation to breast cancer survival in a population-based cohort of women ages 20 to 69 years who were diagnosed with breast cancer in Wisconsin between 1995 and 2003 (N = 5820).
Compared with college graduates, women who had no education beyond high school were 1.39 times more likely (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10-1.76) to die from breast cancer. Women who had household incomes <2.5 times the poverty level were 1.46 times more likely (95% CI, 1.10-1.92) to die from breast cancer than women who had household incomes ≥5 times the poverty level. Adjusting the analysis for use of screening mammography, disease stage at diagnosis, and lifestyle factors eliminated the disparity by income, but the disparity by education persisted (hazard ratio [HR], 1.27; 95% CI, 0.99-1.61). In multilevel analyses, low community-level education was associated with increased breast cancer mortality even after adjusting for individual-level SES (HR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.09-2.27 for ≥20% vs <10% of adults without a high school degree).

Locations of injuries were geocoded, aggregated by census tract, assessed for geospatial clustering, and matched to sociodemographic measures. Negative binomial models were used to evaluate population measures.

Cohort study.
Twenty hospitals designated as Model SCI Systems of care in the United States.
Adults (N=8027) with traumatic SCI, seen in one of the Model SCI Systems, who had at least 1 follow-up assessment between 1995 and 2006. All participants were at least 1 year postinjury at the time of assessment. There were 57,957 person-years and 1036 deaths. The follow-up period started with the first assessment between 1995 and 2006 and went until either the date of death or March 2009.
Not applicable.
Mortality status was determined by routine follow-up supplemented by using the Social Security Death Index. A logistic regression model was developed to estimate the chance of dying in any given year.
Educational status and income were significantly predictive of mortality after adjusting for age, sex, race, and severity of injury. Compared with those with household income of $75,000 or greater, the odds of mortality was greater for those who had income between $25,000 and $75,000 (1.61) and still higher for those with less than $25,000 a year (2.41).

No such studies have examined this association in Texas, a large state with significant ethnic and racial diversity. The objective of this analysis was to determine whether racial disparities in survival for men diagnosed with prostate cancer in Texas from 1995 through 2002 remained after adjusting for SES, rural residence, and stage of disease.
A cohort of 87,449 men who were diagnosed with prostate cancer was identified from the Texas Cancer Registry. The SES measure was based on census tract data reflecting median household income, median home value, and percentages of men living below poverty, with a college education, and with a management or professional occupation. The 5-year survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard modeling was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for race and all-cause and disease-specific mortality.
After adjusting for SES, age, stage of disease, tumor grade, year of diagnosis, and rural residence, both black and Hispanic men were more likely (adjusted HR [aHR], 1.70 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.58-1.83] and aHR, 1.11 [95% CI, 1.02-1.20], respectively) to die of prostate cancer compared with white men. The pattern of survival disadvantage for black men held for those diagnosed with localized disease and advanced disease, and for those with an unknown stage of disease at diagnosis.

Our objective was to identify the predictors of acceptance of referral for hospital care among families of severely ill newborns and infants <59 days old in three low-income communities of Karachi, Pakistan.
A cohort of 541 newborns and infants referred from home by community health workers conducting household surveillance, and diagnosed with a serious illness at local community clinics between 1 January and 31 December 2007, was followed-up within 1 month of referral to the public hospital.
Only 24% of families accepted hospital referral. Major reasons for refusal were financial difficulties (67%) and father/elder denying permission (65%). Religious/cultural beliefs were cited by 20% of families. Referral acceptance was higher with recognition of severity of the illness by mother (odds ratio=12.7; 95% confidence interval=4.6 to 35.2), family's ability to speak the dominant language at hospital (odds ratio=2.0; 95% confidence interval=1.3-3.1), presence of grunting in the infant (odds ratio=3.3; 95% confidence interval=1.2-9.0) and infant temperature <35.5 °C (odds ratio=4.1; 95% confidence interval=2.3 to 7.4).

This registry-based clinical cohort study investigates the relation between socioeconomic position and prognostic markers in 6234 persons included in a national clinical database in 2000-2008, Denmark. Several measures of individual socioeconomic position were achieved from Statistics Denmark. The risk of being diagnosed with advanced disease, as expressed by the six prognostic markers (Ann Arbor stage III or IV, more than one extranodal lesion, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), performance status of two or more, presence of B symptoms and International Prognostic Index (IPI) of two or more), increased with decreasing level of education, in patients living alone, and in men. For instance, a significant decrease in the odds of being diagnosed with elevated LDH (p=0.02), high performance status (p=0.004), high IPI score (p=0.004) and B symptoms (p=0.02) was seen with higher level of education, whereas high stage of disease was significantly less likely in the higher educated (odds ratio [OR]=0.85 (0.74-0.99)). The difference in risk seemed not to be mediated by differences in histological subgroups reflecting aggressiveness of disease among the social groups. One of the most likely mechanisms of the social difference is longer delay in those with low socioeconomic position. The findings of social inequality in prognostic markers in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) patients could already be implemented in the clinical practice if general practitioners (GP's) and physicians on hospitals paid special attention to patients with low educational level and unspecific symptoms.",,,,,

We reviewed data from 4,162 participants of Mexican origin recruited from July 1, 2002, through December 31, 2005, and who were enrolled in a population-based cohort study. Missing yearly income data were imputed using three different single imputation methods and one multiple imputation under a Bayesian approach. Of 4,162 participants, 3,121 were randomly assigned to a training set (to derive the yearly income imputation methods and develop the health-outcome prediction models) and 1,041 to a testing set (to compare the areas under the curve (AUC) of the receiver-operating characteristic of the resulting health-outcome prediction models). The discriminatory powers of the SRH prediction models were good (range, 69-72%) and compared to the prediction model obtained after no imputation of missing yearly income, all other imputation methods improved the prediction of SRH (P < 0.05 for all comparisons) with the AUC for the model after multiple imputation being the highest (AUC = 0.731). Furthermore, given that yearly income was imputed using multiple imputation, the odds of SRH as good or better increased by 11% for each $5,000 increment in yearly income. This study showed that although imputation of missing data for a key predictor variable can improve a risk health-outcome prediction model, further work is needed to illuminate the risk factors associated with SRH.",,,,,

This study analyses the association between unemployment and suicide during different levels of national unemployment adjusting for several factors that might explain or mediate the relationship.
The data comprised annual population-register and death-register information on 25-64-year-old Finns at the beginning of each year in the period 1988-2003; thus, forming 16 separate follow-up cohorts. Experience of unemployment was measured at baseline and during the previous year for each cohort. Suicide was followed for 12 months after each baseline giving a total of 7388 suicides.
Overall, age-adjusted suicide mortality was two to three times higher among the unstably employed and almost fourfold among the long-term unemployed. Adjustment for social class and living arrangements had small effect on the HRs, but adjustment for household income per consumption unit decreased the differences by 13% and 31% among the long-term unemployed women and men, respectively. When the national unemployment level was high, excess suicide mortality among the unstably employed was lower than during low unemployment when those becoming unemployed might be more selected. No such differences were found among the long-term unemployed.
Long-term unemployment seems to have causal effects on suicide, which may be partly mediated by low income. As the effect of unstable employment is lower during the recessionary stage of the economic cycle some part of the excess suicide among the unstably employed is likely to be attributable to selection into unemployment.",,,,,

Car seats were not used by 161 (11.8%) Pacific children at the 6 weeks measurement wave, 71 (5.8%) at 1-year, and 44 (3.8%) at 2 years, while car/booster seats were not used by 139 (13.3%) at the 4 years wave. Multivariable GEE model results revealed that mothers with no formal education, high parity, who smoked tobacco, lower household income, who lacked English language proficiency, and had multiple births were all at higher odds of failing to use car seat/booster seats. Despite differential attrition being noted in mothers over time, a sensitivity analysis using multiple imputation methods yielded similar findings. Targeted initiatives and education programs focusing on these higher risk groups, in particular, is needed to increase uptake and use of CRS thereby decreasing Pacific children's exposure to injury risk. As New Zealand has a large and increasing proportion of Pacific, Maori and Asian people, there is a continuing need to understand cultural factors in traffic safety. Only when culturally appropriate initiatives and education programs have been developed and disseminated that meet the needs of New Zealand's different communities is the national priority likely to be realised.",,,,,

The development of sepsis after elective surgical procedures imposes a significant clinical and resource utilization burden in the United States. We evaluated the development of sepsis after elective procedures in a nationally representative patient cohort and assessed the effect of sociodemographic and hospital characteristics on the development of postoperative sepsis.
The Nationwide inpatient sample was queried between 2002 and 2006 and patients developing sepsis after elective procedures were identified using the patient safety indicator ""Postoperative Sepsis"" (PSI-13). Case-mix adjusted rates were calculated by using a multivariate logistic regression model for sepsis risk and an indirect standardization method.
A total of 6,512,921 weighted elective surgical cases met the inclusion criteria and 78,669 cases (1.21%) developed postoperative sepsis. Case-mix adjustment for age, race, gender, hospital bed size, hospital location, hospital teaching status, and patient income demonstrated esophageal, pancreatic, and gastric procedures represented the greatest risk for the development of postoperative sepsis. Thoracic, adrenal, and hepatic operations accounted for the greatest mortality rates if sepsis developed. Increasing age, Blacks, Hispanics, and men were more likely to develop sepsis. Decreased median household income, larger hospital bed size, urban hospital location, and nonteaching status were associated with greater rates of postoperative sepsis.
The development of postoperative sepsis is multifactorial and procedures, most likely to develop sepsis, did not demonstrate the greatest mortality after sepsis developed. Factors associated with the development of sepsis included race, age, hospital size, hospital location, and patient income. Further evaluation of high-risk procedures, populations, and environments may assist in reducing this costly complication.",,,,,

Objective. The authors sought to determine whether obesity, as measured by body mass index (BMI), was associated with asthma quality of life or asthma-related emergency department (ED)/urgent care utilization in an urban, community-based sample of adults.
This is a cross-sectional analysis of 352 adult subjects (age 30.9 +/- 6.1, 77.8% females, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1))% predicted = 87.0% +/- 18.5%) with physician-diagnosed asthma from a community-based Chicago cohort. Outcome variables included the Juniper Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) scores and health care utilization in the previous 12 months. Bivariate tests were used as appropriate to assess the relationship between BMI or obesity status and asthma outcome variables. Multivariate regression analyses were performed to predict asthma outcomes, controlling for demographics, income, depression score, and beta-agonist use.
One hundred ninety-one (54.3%) adults were obese (BMI > 30 kg/m(2)). Participants with a higher BMI were older (p = .008), African American (p < .001), female (p = .002), or from lower income households (p = .002). BMI was inversely related to overall AQLQ scores (r = -.174, p = .001) as well as to individual domains. In multivariate models, BMI remained an independent predictor of AQLQ. Obese participants were more likely to have received ED/urgent care for asthma than nonobese subjects (odds ratio [OR] = 1.8, p = .036).
In a community-based sample of urban asthmatic adults, obesity was related to worse asthma-specific quality of life and increased ED/urgent care utilization. However, compared to other variables measured such as depression, the contribution of obesity to lower AQLQ scores was relatively modest.",Urban minority populations have increased rates of obesity and asthma.,Is obesity associated with asthma quality of life and emergency care utilization in urban asthmatic adults?,Cross-sectional analysis of 352 adult subjects with physician-diagnosed asthma.

Our aim was to assess these differences in a large cohort of women having experienced severe acute maternal morbidity (SAMM) during pregnancy, delivery and puerperium.
All women experiencing SAMM were prospectively collected in a nationwide population-based design from August 2004 to August 2006. Women delivering in the same period served as reference cohort. Population-based risks were calculated by ethnicity and by type of morbidity. Additionally, non-Western and Western women having experienced SAMM were compared in multivariable logistic regression analysis.
All 98 Dutch maternity units participated. There were 371 021 deliveries during the study period. A total of 2506 women with SAMM were included, 21.1% of whom were non-Western immigrants. Non-Western immigrants showed a 1.3-fold [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-1.5] increased risk to develop SAMM. Large differences were observed among different ethnic minority groups, ranging from a non-increased risk for Moroccan and Turkish women to a 3.5-fold (95% CI 2.8-4.3) increased risk for sub-Saharan African women. Low socio-economic status, unemployment, single household, high parity and prior caesarean were independent explanatory factors for SAMM, although they did not fully explain the differences. Immigration-related characteristics differed by ethnic background.
Non-Western immigrants have an increased risk of developing SAMM as compared to Western women. Risks varied largely by ethnic origin.

We aimed to determine mortality rates for Samoan, Cook Island Māori, Tongan, and Niuean ethnic groups (living in New Zealand). METHODS We used New Zealand Census-Mortality Study (NZCMS) data for 2001-04, for 380,000 person years of follow-up of 0-74 year olds in the 2001-04 cohort for which there was complete data on sex, age, ethnicity (total counts), natality, and household income. Given sparse data, we used hierarchical Bayesian (HB) regression modelling, with: a prior covariate structure specified for sex, age, natality (New Zealand/Overseas born), and household income; and smoothing of rates using shrinkage. The posterior mortality rate estimates were then directly standardised.RESULTS Standardising for sex, age, income, and natality, all-cause mortality rate ratios compared to Samoan were: 1.21 (95% credibility interval 1.05 to 1.42) for Cook Island Māori; 0.93 (0.77 to 1.10) for Tongan; and 1.07 (0.88 to 1.29) for Niuean. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality rate ratios showed greater heterogeneity: 1.66 (1.26 to 2.13) for Cook Island Māori; 1.11 (0.72 to 1.58) for Niuean; and 0.86 (0.58 to 1.20) for Tongan. Results were little different standardising for just sex and age. We conducted a range of sensitivity analyses about a plausible range of (differential) return migration by Pacific people when terminally ill, and a plausible range of census undercounting of Pacific people. Our findings, in particular the elevated CVD mortality among Cook Island Māori, appeared robust. CONCLUSIONS To our knowledge, this project is the first time in New Zealand that clear (and marked in the case of CVD) differences in mortality have been demonstrated between different Pacific ethnic groups.

Our results confirm that childhood conditions such as household income and the quality of the home environment are significant predictors of longevity. Importantly, however, the role of socioeconomic status appears to differ across cause of death, with household income being a significant predictor of death from smoking-related cancer. Moreover, we find that (1) poor housing conditions in childhood is associated with reduced longevity, that (2) early doctor-assessed childhood health conditions significantly predict a reduced length of life, that (3) children born in a location with relatively high infant mortality rates live significantly fewer years, and that (4) there is a high correlation in longevity across children from the same family across all causes of death.

One potential contributing factor to such differences is the personality traits of individuals within these strata. We examined the association between risk-taking attitudes and cardiac patients' clinical and demographic characteristics, the likelihood of undergoing invasive cardiac procedures and survival.
We studied a large inception cohort of patients who underwent cardiac catheterization between July 1998 and December 2001. Detailed clinical and demographic data were collected at time of cardiac catheterization and through a mailed survey one year post-catheterization. The survey included three general risk attitude items from the Jackson Personality Inventory. Patients' (n = 6294) attitudes toward risk were categorized as risk-prone versus non-risk-prone and were assessed for associations with baseline clinical and demographic characteristics, treatment received (i.e., medical therapy, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)), and survival (to December 2005).
2827 patients (45%) were categorized as risk-prone. Having risk-prone attitudes was associated with younger age (p < .001), male sex (p < .001), current smoking (p < .001) and higher household income (p < .001). Risk-prone patients were more likely to have CABG surgery in unadjusted (Odds Ratio [OR] = 1.21; 95% CI 1.08-1.36) and adjusted (OR = 1.18; 95% CI 1.02-1.36) models, but were no more likely to have PCI or any revascularization.

Specifically, we examined (1) how ecologic covariates at the community and neighborhood levels might confound and modify the air pollution-mortality association; (2) how spatial autocorrelation and multiple levels of data (e.g., individual and neighborhood) can be taken into account within the random effects Cox model; (3) how using land-use regression to refine measurements of air pollution exposure to the within-city (or intra-urban) scale might affect the size and significance of health effects in the Los Angeles and New York City regions; and (4) what exposure time windows may be most critical to the air pollution-mortality association. The 18 years of follow-up (extended from 7 years in the original study [Pope et al. 1995]) included vital status data for the CPS-II cohort (approximately 1.2 million participants) with multiple cause-of-death codes through December 31, 2000 and more recent exposure data from air pollution monitoring sites for the metropolitan areas. In the Nationwide Analysis, the influence of ecologic covariate data (such as education attainment, housing characteristics, and level of income; data obtained from the 1980 U.S. Census; see Ecologic Covariates sidebar on page 14) on the air pollution-mortality association were examined at the Zip Code area (ZCA) scale, the metropolitan statistical area (MSA) scale, and by the difference between each ZCA value and the MSA value (DIFF). In contrast to previous analyses that did not directly include ecologic covariates at the ZCA scale, risk estimates increased when ecologic covariates were included at all scales. The ecologic covariates exerted their greatest effect on mortality from ischemic heart disease (IHD), which was also the health outcome most strongly related with exposure to PM2.5 (particles 2.5 microm or smaller in aerodynamic diameter), sulfate (SO4(2-)), and sulfur dioxide (SO2), and the only outcome significantly associated with exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO2). When ecologic covariates were simultaneously included at both the MSA and DIFF levels, the hazard ratio (HR) for mortality from IHD associated with PM2.5 exposure (average concentration for 1999-2000) increased by 7.5% and that associated with SO4(2-) exposure (average concentration for 1990) increased by 12.8%. The two covariates found to exert the greatest confounding influence on the PM2.5-mortality association were the percentage of the population with a grade 12 education and the median household income. Also in the Nationwide Analysis, complex spatial patterns in the CPS-II data were explored with an extended random effects Cox model (see Glossary of Statistical Terms at end of report) that is capable of clustering up to two geographic levels of data. Using this model tended to increase the HR estimate for exposure to air pollution and also to inflate the uncertainty in the estimates. Including ecologic covariates decreased the variance of the results at both the MSA and ZCA scales; the largest decrease was in residual variation based on models in which the MSA and DIFF levels of data were included together, which suggests that partitioning the ecologic covariates into between-MSA and within-MSA values more completely captures the sources of variation in the relationship between air pollution, ecologic covariates, and mortality. Intra-Urban Analyses were conducted for the New York City and Los Angeles regions. The results of the Los Angeles spatial analysis, where we found high exposure contrasts within the Los Angeles region, showed that air pollution-mortality risks were nearly 3 times greater than those reported from earlier analyses. This suggests that chronic health effects associated with intra-urban gradients in exposure to PM2.5 may be even larger between ZCAs within an MSA than the associations between MSAs that have been previously reported. However, in the New York City spatial analysis, where we found very little exposure contrast between ZCAs within the New York region, mortality from all causes, cardiopulmonary disease (CPD), and lung cancer was not elevated. A positive association was seen for PM2.5 exposure and IHD, which provides evidence of a specific association with a cause of death that has high biologic plausibility. These results were robust when analyses controlled (1) the 44 individual-level covariates (from the ACS enrollment questionnaire in 1982; see 44 Individual-Level Covariates sidebar on page 22) and (2) spatial clustering using the random effects Cox model. Effects were mildly lower when unemployment at the ZCA scale was included. To examine whether there is a critical exposure time window that is primarily responsible for the increased mortality associated with ambient air pollution, we constructed individual time-dependent exposure profiles for particulate and gaseous air pollutants (PM2.5 and SO2) for a subset of the ACS CPS-II participants for whom residence histories were available. The relevance of the three exposure time windows we considered was gauged using the magnitude of the relative risk (HR) of mortality as well as the Akaike information criterion (AIC), which measures the goodness of fit of the model to the data. For PM2.5, no one exposure time window stood out as demonstrating the greatest HR; nor was there any clear pattern of a trend in HR going from recent to more distant windows or vice versa. Differences in AIC values among the three exposure time windows were also small. The HRs for mortality associated with exposure to SO2 were highest in the most recent time window (1 to 5 years), although none of these HRs were significantly elevated. Identifying critical exposure time windows remains a challenge that warrants further work with other relevant data sets. This study provides additional support toward developing cost-effective air quality management policies and strategies. The epidemiologic results reported here are consistent with those from other population-based studies, which collectively have strongly supported the hypothesis that long-term exposure to PM2.5 increases mortality in the general population. Future research using the extended Cox-Poisson random effects methods, advanced geostatistical modeling techniques, and newer exposure assessment techniques will provide additional insight.",Particulate air pollution is linked to mortality in large U.S. cities.,How do ecologic covariates and spatial analysis affect the air pollution-mortality association?,Extended follow-up and spatial analysis of the ACS Cancer Prevention Study II cohort.,Ecologic covariates influenced mortality from ischemic heart disease and air pollution.,The study focused on specific regions and exposure time windows.

We analyzed the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development database for the years 1999-2004. We selected NEC-specific ICD-9-CM diagnosis and procedure codes. Mortality rate was the primary outcome measure, and length of stay was used a secondary end-point. We stratified the data by birth weight, gender, race/ethnicity, treatment, median household income, insurance status, admission type (inborn or outborn), and NICU levels.
We identified 3328 infants with NEC (incidence of 1 per 1000 live births). Overall mortality within the NEC cohort was 12.5% (13.4 deaths per 100,000 live births). Male or Hispanic neonates were less likely to survive. Socioeconomic factors, including insurance status and parental median household income, were not predictors of mortality. Neonates treated surgically had a greater mortality rate compared with ones treated nonsurgically. PDA was present in 32% of patients with NEC, and these neonates were more likely to undergo gastrointestinal surgery. The odds of NEC-associated mortality in level IIIC units were significantly greater than any other NICU level. Admission type (inborn versus outborn) was not associated with increased mortality.
Disparities in NEC outcomes are multifactorial with patient- and treatment-specific factors contributing significantly to the unfavorable outcomes.

However, patterns of late mortality, the long-term risks of subsequent neoplasms and debilitating medical conditions, and sociodemographic outcomes have not been comprehensively characterized for individual diagnostic and treatment groups.
We collected information on treatment, mortality, chronic medical conditions, and neurocognitive functioning of adult 5-year survivors of CNS malignancies diagnosed between 1970 and 1986 within the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study. Using competing risk framework, we calculated cumulative mortality according to cause of death and cumulative incidence of subsequent neoplasms according to exposure and dose of cranial radiation therapy (RT). Neurocognitive impairment and socioeconomic outcomes were assessed with respect to dose of CNS radiotherapy to specific brain regions. Cumulative incidence of chronic medical conditions was compared between survivors and siblings using Cox regression models. All tests of statistical significance were two-sided.
Among all eligible 5-year survivors (n = 2821), cumulative late mortality at 30 years was 25.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 23.4% to 28.3%), due primarily to recurrence and/or progression of primary disease. Patients who received cranial RT of 50 Gy or more (n = 813) had a cumulative incidence of a subsequent neoplasm within the CNS of 7.1% (95% CI = 4.5% to 9.6%) at 25 years from diagnosis compared with 1.0% (95% CI = 0% to 2.3%) for patients who had no RT. Survivors had higher risk than siblings of developing new endocrine, neurological, or sensory complications 5 or more years after diagnosis. Neurocognitive impairment was high and proportional to radiation dose for specific tumor types. There was a dose-dependent association between RT to the frontal and/or temporal lobes and lower rates of employment, and marriage.

The purpose of this study was to examine how cancer survival varies by socioeconomic status (SES) among women in Norway, and to identify factors that explain this variation. SES was measured by years of education and gross household income, respectively.
We used data from The Norwegian Women and Cancer Study, a prospective cohort study including 91,814 women who responded to an extensive questionnaire between 1996 and 1998. A total of 3,899 incident cancer cases were diagnosed during follow-up, of whom 1,089 women died, 919 of them from cancer. Cox Proportional Hazards Model was used to calculate relative risks (RR) of mortality and 95% confidence intervals.
We observed an overall negative socioeconomic gradient in cancer survival, which was most evident in the site specific analyses for survival of ovarian cancer by years of education. For colorectal cancer, mortality increased with years of education, but not with income. After adjustment for household size, marital status, disease stage, and smoking status the SES variation in cancer survival became non-significant. We found that the unequal socioeconomic distribution of smoking status prior to diagnosis contributed considerably to the poorer survival in low SES groups.

This review includes previously published manuscripts that used CCSS data focused on psychological outcome measures, including the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI-18), the Medical Outcomes Survey Short Form-36 (SF-36), the Cantril Ladder of Life, and other self-report questionnaires. Comparisons and contrasts are made between siblings and survivors, and to normative data when available, in light of demographic/health information and abstracted data from the medical record. These studies demonstrate that a significant proportion of survivors report more symptoms of global distress and poorer physical, but not emotional, domains of HRQOL. Other than brain tumor survivors, most survivors report both good present and expected future life satisfaction. Risk factors for psychological distress and poor HRQOL are female sex, lower educational attainment, unmarried status, annual household income less than $20,000, unemployment, lack of health insurance, presence of a major medical condition, and treatment with cranial radiation and/or surgery. Cranial irradiation impacted neurocognitive outcomes, especially in brain tumor survivors. Psychological distress also predicted poor health behaviors, including smoking, alcohol use, fatigue, and altered sleep. Psychological distress and pain predicted use of complementary and alternative medicine. Overall, most survivors are psychologically healthy and report satisfaction with their lives. However, certain groups of childhood cancer survivors are at high risk for psychological distress, neurocognitive dysfunction, and poor HRQOL, especially in physical domains.

The main objective of our study was to investigate whether mortality, from cardiovascular disease or other causes, varies by neighbourhood socioeconomic gradients in patients accessing the healthcare system for cardiovascular disease management.
A cohort of 485 patients with angiographic evidence of coronary artery disease (CAD) and neighbourhood socioeconomic status information was followed for 13.3 years. Survival analyses were completed with adjustment for potentially confounding risk factors. There were 64 cases of cardiovascular mortality and 66 deaths from non-cardiovascular chronic diseases. No socioeconomic differentials in cardiovascular mortality were observed. However, lower neighbourhood employment, education, and median family income did predict an increased risk of mortality from non-cardiovascular chronic diseases. For each quintile decrease in neighbourhood socioeconomic status, non-cardiovascular mortality risk rose by 21-30%. Covariate-adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) for non-cardiovascular mortality were 1.21 (1.02-1.42), 1.21 (1.01-1.46), and 1.30 (1.06-1.60), for each quintile decrease in neighbourhood education, employment, and income, respectively. These patterns were primarily attributable to mortality from cancer. Estimated risks for mortality from cancer rose by 42% and 62% for each one quintile decrease in neighbourhood median income and employment rate, respectively. Although only baseline clinical information was collected and patient-level socioeconomic data were not available, our results suggest that environmental socioeconomic factors have a significant impact on CAD patient survival.
Despite public health care access, CAD patients who reside in lower-socioeconomic neighbourhoods show increased vulnerability to non-cardiovascular chronic disease mortality, particularly in the domain of cancer.

We examined whether women's mobility trajectories might contribute to CVD mortality beyond what could be expected from their childhood and adult social class position. The Swedish Work and Mortality Data Base provided childhood (1960) and adulthood (1990) social indicators. Women born 1945-59 (N=791 846) were followed up for CVD mortality 1990-2002 (2019 deaths) by means of logistic regression analysis. CVD mortality risks were estimated for 16 mobility trajectories. Gross and net impact of four childhood and four adult classes, based on occupation, were analysed for mortality in ischemic heart disease (IHD), stroke, other CVD, - and all CVD. Differences between the two most extreme trajectories were 10-fold, but the common trajectory of moving from manual to non-manual position was linked to only a slight excess mortality (OR=1.26) compared to the equally common trajectory of maintaining a stable non-manual position (reference category). Moving into adult manual class resulted in an elevated CVD mortality whatever the childhood position (ORs varied between 1.42 and 2.24). After adjustment for adult class, childhood class had some effect, in particular there was a low risk of coming from a self-employed childhood class on all outcomes (all ORs around=0.80). A woman's own education had a stronger influence on the mortality estimates than did household income. Social mobility trajectories among Swedish women are linked to their CVD mortality risk.

We developed models using the human capital approach, which relies on earnings as a measure of productivity, to estimate the value of productivity lost as a result of cancer mortality. The base model aggregated age- and sex-specific data from four primary sources: 1) the US Bureau of the Census, 2) US death certificate data for 1999-2003, 3) cohort life tables from the Berkeley Mortality Database for 1900-2000, and 4) the Bureau of Labor Statistics Current Population Survey. In a model that included costs of caregiving and household work, data from the National Human Activity Pattern Survey and the Caregiving in the U.S. study were used. Sensitivity analyses were performed using six types of cancer assuming a 1% decline in cancer mortality rates. The values of forgone earnings for employed individuals and imputed forgone earnings for informal caregiving were then estimated for the years 2000-2020.
The annual productivity cost from cancer mortality in the base model was approximately $115.8 billion in 2000; the projected value was $147.6 billion for 2020. Death from lung cancer accounted for more than 27% of productivity costs. A 1% annual reduction in lung, colorectal, breast, leukemia, pancreatic, and brain cancer mortality lowered productivity costs by $814 million per year. Including imputed earnings lost due to caregiving and household activity increased the base model total productivity cost to $232.4 billion in 2000 and to $308 billion in 2020.
Investments in programs that target the cancers with high incidence and/or cancers that occur in younger, working-age individuals are likely to yield the greatest reductions in productivity losses to society.",,,,,

Individual-level socioeconomic data are not routinely reported by cancer registries in the United States because they are not available in patient hospital records. The U.S. representative National Longitudinal Mortality Study (NLMS) data provide self-reported, detailed demographic and socioeconomic data from the Social and Economic Supplement to the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey (CPS). In 1999, the NCI initiated the SEER-NLMS study, linking the population-based SEER cancer registry data to NLMS data. The SEER-NLMS data provide a new unique research resource that is valuable for health disparity research on cancer burden. We describe the design, methods, and limitations of this data set. We also present findings on cancer-related health disparities according to individual-level socioeconomic status (SES) and demographic characteristics for all cancers combined and for cancers of the lung, breast, prostate, cervix, and melanoma.
Records of cancer patients diagnosed in 1973-2001 when residing 1 of 11 SEER registries were linked with 26 NLMS cohorts. The total number of SEER matched cancer patients that were also members of an NLMS cohort was 26,844. Of these 26,844 matched patients, 11,464 were included in the incidence analyses and 15,357 in the late-stage diagnosis analyses. Matched patients (used in the incidence analyses) and unmatched patients were compared by age group, sex, race, ethnicity, residence area, year of diagnosis, and cancer anatomic site. Cohort-based age-adjusted cancer incidence rates were computed. The impact of socioeconomic status on cancer incidence and stage of diagnosis was evaluated.
Men and women with less than a high school education had elevated lung cancer rate ratios of 3.01 and 2.02, respectively, relative to their college educated counterparts. Those with family annual incomes less than $12,500 had incidence rates that were more than 1.7 times the lung cancer incidence rate of those with incomes $50,000 or higher. Lower income was also associated with a statistically significantly increased risk of distant-stage breast cancer among women and distant-stage prostate cancer among men.
Socioeconomic patterns in incidence varied for specific cancers, while such patterns for stage were generally consistent across cancers, with late-stage diagnoses being associated with lower SES. These findings illustrate the potential for analyzing disparities in cancer outcomes according to a variety of individual-level socioeconomic, demographic, and health care characteristics, as well as by area measures available in the linked database.",SEER-NLMS study links SEER cancer registry data to NLMS data to study cancer disparities based on SES and demographic characteristics.,How does individual-level SES impact cancer incidence and stage of diagnosis?,"Linking SEER cancer registry data to NLMS data, analyzing cancer patients diagnosed in 1973-2001, comparing matched and unmatched patients, computing age-adjusted cancer incidence rates, evaluating impact of SES on cancer incidence and stage of diagnosis.","Lower SES associated with elevated lung cancer rates, increased risk of distant-stage breast and prostate cancer, varying incidence patterns for specific cancers, consistent patterns for stage across cancers.","Data limited to patients residing in 11 SEER registries, reliance on self-reported NLMS data, potential confounding factors not fully addressed."

The NIH-NHLBI-sponsored Women's Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation (WISE) enrolled 819 women referred for clinically indicated coronary angiography. This study's primary end point was to evaluate the independent contribution of socioeconomic factors on the estimation of time to cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction (MI) (n = 79) using Cox proportional hazards models. Secondary aims included an examination of cardiovascular costs and quality of life within socioeconomic subsets of women.
In univariable models, socioeconomic factors associated with an elevated risk of cardiovascular death or MI included an annual household income <$20,000 (p = 0.0001), <9th grade education (p = 0.002), being African American, Hispanic, Asian, or American Indian (p = 0.016), on Medicaid, Medicare, or other public health insurance (p < 0.0001), unmarried (p = 0.001), unemployed or employed part-time (p < 0.0001), and working in a service job (p = 0.003). Of these socioeconomic factors, income (p = 0.006) remained a significant predictor of cardiovascular death or MI in risk-adjusted models that controlled for angiographic coronary disease, chest pain symptoms, and cardiac risk factors. Low-income women, with an annual household income <$20,000, were more often uninsured or on public insurance (p < 0.0001) yet had the highest 5-year hospitalization and drug treatment costs (p < 0.0001). Only 17% of low-income women had prescription drug coverage (vs. >or=50% of higher-income households, p < 0.0001), and 64% required >or=2 anti-ischemic medications during follow-up (compared with 45% of those earning >or=$50,000, p < 0.0001).

A national retrospective cohort study linking census to mortality records carried out in New Zealand during a 3-year period following the 1991 census and including children aged 0-14 years on census night. The main outcome measures are odds ratios (ORs) for unintentional injury death by equivalised household income category and proportional reductions (population-attributable risk) in unintentional injury mortality from modelled scenarios of nil poverty.
One-third of children lived in households earning less than 60% of the national median household income. Age-adjusted odds of death from unintentional injury were higher for children from any income category compared with the highest, and were most elevated for children from households earning less than 40% of the national median income (OR 2.81, 95% CI 1.73 to 4.55). Adjusting for ethnicity, household education, family status and labour force status halved the effect size (OR 1.83, 1.02 to 3.28). Thirty per cent of injury mortality was attributable to low or middle household income using the highest income category as reference. Altering the income distribution to eradicate poverty, defined by a threshold of 50% or 60% of the national median income, reduced injury mortality in this model by a magnitude of 3.3% to 6.6%.

Overall stage of laryngeal cancer (early vs advanced) and tumor size (T stage) at diagnosis.
Patients with advanced-stage laryngeal cancer at diagnosis were more likely to be uninsured (odds ratio [OR], 1.97; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.79-2.15) or covered by Medicaid (OR, 2.40; 95% CI, 2.21-2.61) compared with those with private insurance.

To examine the relationship between measures of gender role orientation at baseline in 1988 and mortality from CHD over 17 years (to June 2005).
Prospective cohort study linked to national mortality reporting.
Socially varied, mainly urban area centred on city of Glasgow in West Central Scotland, UK.
In total, 1551 participants (704 men and 847 women) aged 55 years took part in detailed interviews with nurses trained in survey methods in 1988. These included a wide range of measures of physical development and functioning, self reported health and health behaviour, personal and social circumstances and a measure of gender role orientation (yielding scores for 'masculinity' and 'femininity').
Mortality from CHD up to June 2005 (88 CHD deaths in men; 41 CHD deaths in women).
After adjusting for smoking, binge drinking, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, household income and psychological well-being, higher 'femininity' scores in men were associated with a lower risk of CHD death (hazards ratio per unit increase in 'femininity' score 0.65, 95% CIs 0.48-0.87, P = 0.004). No such relationship was observed amongst women. 'Masculinity' scores were unrelated to CHD mortality in either men or women.
These results suggest that social constructions of gender influence the risk of ill health, here death from CHD.

While several studies have reported an association of low neighbourhood socio-economic status with morbidity, mortality and health risk behaviour, little is known of the health effects of neighbourhood crime rates. Using the ongoing 10-Town study in Finland, we examined the relations of average household income and crime rate measured at the local area level, with smoking status and intensity by linking census data of local area characteristics from 181 postal zip codes to survey responses to smoking behaviour in a cohort of 23,008 municipal employees. Gender-stratified multilevel analyses adjusted for age and individual occupational status revealed an association between low local area income rate and current smoking. High local area crime rate was also associated with current smoking. Both local area characteristics were strongly associated with smoking intensity. Among ever-smokers, being an ex-smoker was less likely among residents in areas with low average household income and a high crime rate. In the fully adjusted model, the association between local area income and smoking behaviour among women was substantially explained by the area-level crime rate.

We examined the association of long-term exposure to particulate matter of less than 2.5 microm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) with cardiovascular events.
We studied 65,893 postmenopausal women without previous cardiovascular disease in 36 U.S. metropolitan areas from 1994 to 1998, with a median follow-up of 6 years. We assessed the women's exposure to air pollutants using the monitor located nearest to each woman's residence. Hazard ratios were estimated for the first cardiovascular event, adjusting for age, race or ethnic group, smoking status, educational level, household income, body-mass index, and presence or absence of diabetes, hypertension, or hypercholesterolemia.
A total of 1816 women had one or more fatal or nonfatal cardiovascular events, as confirmed by a review of medical records, including death from coronary heart disease or cerebrovascular disease, coronary revascularization, myocardial infarction, and stroke. In 2000, levels of PM2.5 exposure varied from 3.4 to 28.3 microg per cubic meter (mean, 13.5). Each increase of 10 microg per cubic meter was associated with a 24% increase in the risk of a cardiovascular event (hazard ratio, 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09 to 1.41) and a 76% increase in the risk of death from cardiovascular disease (hazard ratio, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.25 to 2.47). For cardiovascular events, the between-city effect appeared to be smaller than the within-city effect.

Using a large, stratified, random sample (2,767 subjects) from the population-based Ansan Geriatric study, the present study sought to assess the morbidity and comorbidity, and to determine the relationships of these variables with sociodemographic and health characteristics in elderly people in South Korea.
A total of 2,767 subjects (1,215 men and 1,552 women) aged 60-84 years were randomly selected from September 2002 to August 2003 in Ansan, South Korea. Data on sociodemographic and health characteristics, and clinical diagnosis were collected using questionnaires. When available, the medical records and medications taken by the subjects were also cross-checked.
Of the total subjects, 78.0% reported diagnosed disease, 11.0% had been cured, and 46.8% had been diagnosed with more than two diseases. The mean number of morbidities per person among elderly Koreans was 1.62 +/- 1.35 (mean +/- standard deviation), and women had a greater number of diseases per person than did men. The most common morbidities were chronic diseases such as hypertension, arthritis, and diabetes mellitus. In women, osteoporosis and arthritis were the second and third most prevalent diseases, respectively. Morbidity was significantly associated with gender, employment, household income, alcohol intake, self-assessed health status, and worries about health.
These data will enhance understanding of the patterns of health problems among elderly Koreans and will contribute to the application of appropriate intervention strategies.",,,,,

We studied a retrospective cohort of 5622 patients who presented to a hospital emergency department with an initial episode of acute myocardial infarction between April 1998 and March 2002 in the Province of Alberta, Canada. Our main outcome measure was 1-year all-cause mortality following the index emergency department visit; we used socioeconomic status (measured by neighborhood median household income) as our main predictor after controlling for patient and hospital characteristics and revascularization.
Socioeconomic status profoundly affected the rate of emergency department presentation and the process and outcome of acute myocardial infarction care. In patients belonging to the lowest versus the highest socioeconomic status quartile, the risk of presenting to the emergency department was 72% higher (P <.001); at 1 year, revascularization was lower (36% vs 48%, P <.001), and mortality higher (19.1% vs 9.1%, P <.001). Socioeconomic status was independently associated with 1-year mortality after adjustment for baseline characteristics and 1-year revascularization, and socioeconomic status was especially influential in non-revascularized patients.
Given the influence of socioeconomic status on mortality after acute myocardial infarction and the key role of revascularization in modulating this relationship, our study has important implications for access to and process of cardiac care.",,,,,

However, substantial declines in cardiovascular mortality mean that its absolute contribution to overall mortality has decreased.
How did the absolute contribution of major causes of death to socioeconomic inequalities in New Zealand change during the 1980s and 90s?
Linked census-mortality cohorts were used to calculate the contribution of different causes of death to inequalities in mortality, measured with the slope index of inequality, by household income.
Between 1981-4 and 1996-9, the contribution of cardiovascular disease (CVD) to total inequality declined from 55% to 28% among women, whereas at the same time the contribution of cancers increased from 14% to 37%. Among men, the contribution of CVD to total inequality peaked at 47% in 1986-9, then declined to 38% in 1996-9. The contribution of cancer increased from 19% to 26% in men.
CVD mortality has declined at all income levels and so too has the contribution of CVD to mortality inequalities. Concurrently, the contribution of cancer to inequalities in mortality by income has increased and, in women at least, is now greater than the contribution of CVD. It is hypothesised that a similar crossover is occurring in other populations where CVD mortality has declined, although socioeconomic differences in the distribution and effect of the obesity epidemic for CVD may ensure its continuing importance.

This study sought to determine if racial disparities exist between black and white patients with HNSCC treated at a single large institution in the South with a high proportion of black patients.
The authors conducted a nonrandomized retrospective cohort analysis.
The tumor registry was used to identify patients diagnosed with HNSCC from 1985 to 2002. The medical records of non-Hispanic white and black adult patients were retrospectively reviewed. Median household income, percentage of population below poverty level, and education level based on census tract and block information were obtained from U.S. Census 2000 data. Standard statistical analysis, including Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis and Cox proportional hazards models, was used to analyze the effects of covariables on survival.
A total of 1,128 patients met study criteria (478 black, 650 white). Compared with white patients, black patients were significantly younger (mean age, 53.9 vs. 56.4 years, P<.0001), male (81.2% vs. 72.3%, P=.0005), more commonly abused alcohol (88.0% vs. 74.3%, P<.0001), and were significantly less likely to have insurance (8.6% vs. 21.7%, P<.0001). There was no difference in the incidence of tobacco use (91.7%), advanced comorbidity (35.9%), or primary tumor site. Black patients had a significantly greater incidence of stage IV disease (65.7% vs. 46.6%, P<.0001) and nonoperative treatment (48.7% vs. 30.8%, P<.0001), which was performed for inoperable disease in 57.1% of black compared with 31.0% of white patients (P<.0001). Black patients resided in census block groups with significantly lower mean education level, median income, and a higher percentage of population below poverty compared with white patients. The 5-year disease-specific survival differed significantly between black (29.3%) and white (54.7%) patients (P<.0001). Cox proportional hazards models revealed that alcohol abuse, advanced TNM stage, high tumor grade, nodal disease, extracapsular spread, advanced comorbidity, and regional or distant metastatic disease were associated with poorer survival for all patients. An interaction with race was found for insurance status, nonoperative treatment, and extracapsular spread. Stepwise variable selection adjusting for patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics showed a significant effect only for race by payor status on disease-specific survival (P=.0228).
Insurance status, treatment, and extracapsular spread differentially affected the survival of black patients compared with white patients. Only insurance status had a significant effect on survival in black patients after controlling for other variables.

Childhood SEP indicators were father's education, own education, father's occupational class at age 14, own first occupational class after age 15, birth place, and residence at age 14. Adulthood SEP indicators included current occupational class, family income, perceived economic hardships, and current residence.
Mortality differentials according to current occupational class, economic hardship and current residence were statistically significant. Mortality risk tended to increase as household income decreased. For all childhood SEP indicators, inverse relationships between childhood SEP and mortality risk were found. These inverse relationships were attenuated but did not disappear with adjustment for each adulthood SEP indicator. However, the statistically significant association between childhood SEP and mortality risk did not persist after full adjustment for four adulthood SEP indicators.

The apparent contribution of smoking to mortality differences between Māori and non-Māori non-Pacific people was greatest for women in 1996-99 (8% reduction in standardised rate difference); it had increased from 3% in 1981-84. The corresponding reductions in men were 5% in 1996-99 and -1% in 1981-84. The apparent contribution of socioeconomic factors to mortality differences between Māori and non-Māori non-Pacific was greatest for men (39% in 1981-84 and 37% in 1996-99) and increased over time for women (from 23% in 1981-84 to 32% in 1996-99).
Although small, the contribution of smoking to ethnic inequalities in mortality increased over time and might grow more during the next two decades if differences in smoking between ethnic groups continue to increase. Better measurement of socioeconomic position (eg, lifecourse measures, asset wealth) might increase the proportion of ethnic inequalities attributable to socioeconomic position, perhaps to about half. Action to redress socioeconomic gaps and control of tobacco use will both be important in reducing ethnic inequalities in health.",Tobacco smoking and socioeconomic position contribute to mortality differences in New Zealand.,How do smoking and socioeconomic factors contribute to mortality differences between ethnic groups in New Zealand?,Linked census and mortality cohort datasets to analyze smoking and socioeconomic position effects on mortality differences.,"Smoking and socioeconomic factors contributed to mortality differences, with increasing impact over time.

In a large prospective cohort of patients with SLE, we used the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate survival probabilities of SLE patients over time since diagnosis. We analyzed the predictors of survival in SLE using Cox proportional hazards models.The study included 1378 patients with SLE, with a median follow-up in the cohort of 6.1 years. One hundred eighteen patients died (8.6%). The overall cumulative probability of survival after disease diagnosis at 5, 10, 15, and 20 years was 95%, 91%, 85%, and 78%, respectively. Based on a multivariable model, age at SLE diagnosis >or=50 years old (hazard ratio [HR]=5.9; p<.001) and male gender (HR=2.4; p=.004) were associated with poorer survival. Patients with annual family income<25,000 dollars had poorer survival (HR=1.7; p=.040). The presence of hemolytic anemia in the first year after disease diagnosis (p=.016) or during the follow-up period (p=.031) increased the risk of death.

Many national census surveys gather information on both the respondent's individual income and the income for the entire household, giving researchers a choice of census income measures. We compared the extent to which individual respondent income and household income (both obtained from census data) are associated with outcomes in a cohort of patients with cardiac disease.
We used data from the Alberta Provincial Project for Outcome Assessment in Coronary Heart Disease (APPROACH), where postal codes were linked to the Postal Code Conversion File (PCCF) to determine each patient's census Dissemination Areas (DA). DA-derived median household income and median individual income were obtained from the 2001 Canadian Census and survival outcomes were then directly determined for income groupings defined by quintile. Two-year survival adjusted for age and sex was described with a proportional hazards analysis.
There were 9,397 patients undergoing cardiac catheterization between January 1, 2001 and March 31, 2002, with complete DA-level median income measures. Household income quintiles yielded a wider spread of survival across quintiles (range of 2-year estimated survival, 91.8% to 95.9% for household income versus 92.8% to 95.6% for respondent income), as well as a more progressive decline in survival as income decreased. This progressive decline was not seen for the respondent income measure.
The greater spread and progressive decline of survival for household income relative to respondent income leads us to conclude that household income is the better socio-economic determinant of health in our data and for the outcome measure we studied.
Les mesures basées sur le recensement du revenu dérivé du revenu médian d’un secteur géographique sont souvent employées dans la recherche de la santé. Beaucoup d’enquêtes nationales de recensement recueillent l’information sur le revenu individuel du répondant ainsi que le revenu pour le ménage entier, donnant aux chercheurs un choix de mesures de revenu. Nous avons comparé le point auquel le revenu individuel du répondant et le revenu du ménage (tous les deux obtenus à partir de données de recensement) sont associés aux résultats dans une cohorte de patients présentant pour une cathérisation cardiaque.
Nous avons employé des données du projet Alberta Provincial Project for Outcome Assessment in Coronary Heart Disease (APPROACH), où des codes postaux ont été liés au fichier de conversion des codes postaux plus (FCCP+) pour déterminer les aires de diffusion (AD) du recensement de chaque patient. Le revenu du ménage médian dérivé des AD et le revenu individuel médian ont été obtenus à partir du recensement du Canada de 2001, et des résultats de survie ont été directement déterminés pour des groupements de revenu définis par quintile. La survie de deux ans ajustée à l’âge et au sexe a été décrite avec une analyse de risques proportionnels.
Il y avait 9 397 patients subissant la cathérisation cardiaque entre le 1 janvier, 2001 et le 31 mars, 2002, avec des mesures médianes de revenu de niveau des AD complets.

The importance of assessing disability and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with MDD has only recently been recognized. The aim of this study was to examine sociodemographic and clinical correlates of HRQOL in a large cohort of outpatients with MDD.
Baseline assessments were completed for 1500 consecutive patients enrolled in the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression trial, including sociodemographic characteristics and measures of depressive symptom severity, clinical features, and HRQOL. Multiple domains of HRQOL were assessed with the 12-item Short Form Health Survey, the Work and Social Adjustment Scale, and the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire. The current analyses were conducted on HRQOL data available for 1397 of the 1500 subjects.
Greater symptom severity was associated with reduced HRQOL by all measures. Even after age and symptom severity were controlled for, a number of clinical features and sociodemographic characteristics were independently associated with HRQOL in multiple domains, including age at onset of MDD, ethnicity, marital status, employment status, education level, insurance status, and monthly household income.
Results strongly suggest the need to assess HRQOL in addition to symptoms in order to gauge the true severity of MDD. This study also highlights the necessity of measuring HRQOL in multiple domains.

This study examines child mortality inequality by household income between 1981 and 1999, by cause of death.
Data was used from a record linkage study of census and mortality records of all New Zealand children aged 0-14 years on census night 1981, 1986, 1991, 1996 followed up for 3 years for specific causes of mortality between ages 1-14 years. All cohorts were combined to calculate mortality rates, rate ratios, and rates differences for each cause of death.
Socioeconomic differences in child mortality (low income compared to high income) were observed for injury (non road traffic) (RR 1.87, 1.35 to 2.58), road traffic injury (RR 1.36, 1.01 to 1.82), and 'other' causes of death (RR 1.81, 1.32 to 2.47). 'Other' and non-road traffic injury deaths together contributed 70% of the total gap in child mortality between the rich and the poor.
Socioeconomic differences existed across most broad causes of child death. The major contributors to mortality inequality are diverse, suggesting that the similar distal causes of inequality (e.g. poverty) play out through a myriad of proximal causes. Fortunately there appears to be some scope for policymakers to modify some of the proximal and distal causes of these inequalities.",Socioeconomic inequalities in child mortality exist in New Zealand.,How have child mortality inequalities by household income changed in New Zealand from 1981 to 1999?,Record linkage study analyzing child mortality inequalities by socioeconomic position over different time periods.,"Socioeconomic differences existed across most causes of child death, with diverse contributors to mortality inequality.","Changes in income levels may have influenced relative inequality trends, but absolute inequality remained stable."

And they suggest that risk of death increases in a cumulative fashion. Few studies have investigated the life-course influences on social inequality in mortality in early old age. In this study we wanted to follow a cohort through their adult working age into retirement and investigate pathways that may give increased risk of mortality. A cohort of all inhabitants in the age range 68-72 who lived in the municipality of Oslo on 1st January 1990 was selected. Data were obtained by linking censuses from 1960, 1970 and 1980 with tax registry in 1990 and death registry 1990-1998. Independent variables were occupational class in 1960, 1970 and 1980 and household income in 1990. Occupational class was coded as manual and non-manual and household income as above or below median household income. A cumulative model was developed by adding times of disadvantage. Then a pathway model was developed which investigated the specific trajectories individuals followed. Most of the increased risk of death was explained by individuals' social conditions in 1990. In the cumulative model, there was no clear gradient in the groups between the bottom and top categories. This suggests that the cumulative model is not important in the high mortality age and that the relative importance of a cumulative effect varies by stages of the life course.",Disadvantage across the life course influences mortality risk in older individuals.,How do life-course influences impact social inequality in mortality in early old age?,"Cohort study following individuals through adult working age into retirement, analyzing occupational class, education, income, and mortality risk.",Social conditions in 1990 had a significant impact on mortality risk.

Yet, the validity of such area-based measures relative to 'true' individual-level income has not been fully characterized.
The objectives of this study were (1) to determine whether area-based measures of household income are a suitable proxy for self-reported household income and (2) to assess whether these measures are associated with outcomes in a cardiac disease cohort.
We used a prospective cohort from the Alberta Provincial Project for Outcome Assessment in Coronary Heart Disease (APPROACH) cardiac catheterization registry.
A total of 4372 patients having undergone cardiac catheterization and who also completed a 1-year follow-up questionnaire on self-reported income level were studied.
Our measurements were survival to 2.5 years after catheterization and health-related quality of life (EuroQoL).
Agreement between the 2 income measures generally was poor (unweighted Kappa = 0.07), particularly for the low-income patients. Despite this poor agreement, both income measures were positively associated with survival and EuroQoL scores. An outcome analysis that simultaneously considered individual level income and area-based income revealed that low-income individuals have poorer survival and lower quality of life scores if they live in low income neighborhoods, but not if they live in high income neighborhoods.
The area-based estimates of household income in these data demonstrate poor agreement with self-reported household income at the level of individual patients, particularly for low-income patients. Despite this, both income measures appear to be prognostically relevant, perhaps because individual and neighborhood income measure different constructs.",Area-based measures of household income may not fully represent individual-level income.,"Are area-based measures of household income suitable proxies for individual-level income, and how do they relate to health outcomes?",Prospective cohort study comparing area-based and self-reported household income measures in a cardiac disease cohort.,"Poor agreement between area-based and self-reported income measures, but both were associated with survival outcomes.",Poor agreement between income measures may impact the interpretation of income-related health outcomes.

The authors hypothesized that higher levels of SES would be associated with better survival, potentially through demographic, circumstance, or care factors.
A cohort investigation of OHCA due to heart disease treated by emergency medical services between January 1, 1999, and December 31, 2003, was conducted in the study county. Socioeconomic status was assessed using two different measures: an individual-level measure, tax-assessed property value per unit, and a geography-based measure, median household income from the 2000 Census. The authors used logistic regression to evaluate the association between survival to hospital discharge and quartile of SES. Models systematically adjusted for demographic, circumstance, and care factors that could potentially confound the association.
Socioeconomic status as measured by value per unit was associated with survival in unadjusted models (odds ratio [OR] = 1.21; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 1.05 to 1.36, for each successive increase in value-per-unit quartile). Adjustment for demographic, circumstance, and care factors altered the association only slightly (fully adjusted OR = 1.23; 95% CI = 1.08 to 1.39). In contrast, SES as measured by median household income was not associated with survival. The study could not investigate all potentially explanatory factors. The findings may not be generalizable to persons or communities that differ from the current investigation.

Census records of inhabitants in Oslo 1990 aged 45 to 64 were linked to death records 1990-98 (n?=?88,159). All inhabitants were included except those who lacked census data on the independent variables. The relative index of inequality (RII) for each indicator was calculated.
Education, occupation, and housing conditions had similar RIIs for all-cause mortality in both sexes. Household income had low RIIs, particularly in men. For the 12 most common causes of death some heterogeneity in the relative ranking between the four indicators was observed, with causes of death known to be related to early-life social circumstances (stomach cancer, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) being particularly strongly related to education, and causes of death which were likely to be determined by adult social circumstances (violence, sudden unexpected death) being particularly strongly related to occupation and housing conditions.
Education, occupational class, and housing conditions all seemed to discriminate all-cause mortality to a similar degree.

This study examines the trends in child mortality inequality between 1981 and 1999 against the background of the rapid and dramatic social and economic restructuring in New Zealand during this time period.
Record linkage studies of census and mortality records of all New Zealand children aged 0-14 years on census night 1981, 1986, 1991, 1996, each followed up for three years for mortality between ages 1-14 years. Socioeconomic position was measured using maternal education, household income, and highest occupational class in the household. Standardised mortality rates, rate ratios, and rates differences as well as regression based measures of inequality were calculated.
Mortality in all socioeconomic groups fell between 1981 and 1999. Socioeconomic inequality in child mortality existed by all measures of socioeconomic position, however only trends by income suggested a change over time: the relative index of inequality increased from 1.5 in 1981-84 to 1.8 in 1996-99 (p trend 0.06), but absolute inequality remained stable (slope index of inequality 15/100 000 in 1981-84 and 14/100 000 in 1996-99.
Dramatic changes in income in New Zealand possibly translated into increasing relative inequality in child mortality by income, but not by education or occupational class. The a priori hypothesis that socioeconomic inequalities in child mortality would have increased in New Zealand during a period of rapid structural reform and widening income inequalities was only partly supported.",,,,,

A search for relevant literature was made in April-May 2004, using Medline and other databases, and via inquiries to official and other agencies. Data on the types of households with smoking members were obtained by an analysis of 1996 Census data.
National survey data indicate that at least 18% of all New Zealanders and 30% of Maori are exposed to SHS in the home. Surveys of high school students indicate home SHS exposure levels of 30% or more. The exposure appears to have decreased during 1996-2003 for Maori and the general population (p<0.001 for trend for both), with low-income households more likely to be exposed than others. There is an absence of exposure data for many specific population groups including pregnant women and infants. New Zealand evidence from two large cohort studies indicates an increased risk of death of at least 15% for never smokers, aged 45-74, if they live in a household with smokers. Over 250 deaths per year are estimated to be attributable to SHS exposure in New Zealand homes; over double the mortality from SHS exposure at work.
Improved information on SHS exposure in the New Zealand setting is needed. The levels of home SHS exposure and estimated mortality burden justify a substantial Government and health-agency investment to reduce this exposure, particularly for children, Maori, and those in low-income households.",,,,,

To determine the frequency of reported financial disability in older adults being discharged from a hospital, to determine patient characteristics associated with financial disability, and to examine the relationship between financial disability and functional decline and mortality.
Prospective cohort study.
Two thousand two hundred patients 70 years and older admitted to the general medicine services at two teaching hospitals in Ohio.
Respondents were interviewed at the time of discharge to determine patients' financial ability to pay for 6 needs: groceries, general bills, medications, medical bills, a small emergency, and a major emergency. We determined functional decline in ability to perform activities of daily living from discharge to 90 days post-hospital discharge, and death 1 year after hospital discharge.
Financial disability was reported to be severe (unable to pay for 3-6 needs) for 21% of patients and moderate (unable to pay for 1-2 needs) for 36%. Financial disability was more common and more severe (P<.001) in persons with an annual household income less than $10,000, in persons with fewer than 12 years of formal education, in African Americans, and in women. In patients with no financial disability, moderate financial disability, and severe financial disability, functional decline 3 months after hospital discharge occurred in 15%, 20%, and 25%, respectively (P=.001), and 1-year mortality rates were 24%, 27%, and 32%, respectively (P=.002). After adjustment for potential confounders, the association of financial disability with functional decline (P=.003) and mortality (P=.02) remained significant.
Reports of financial disability at hospital discharge identified vulnerable older adults with increased risk for functional decline and death. Interventions that alleviate financial disability may improve health outcomes in older adults discharged from hospital.",,,,,

The purpose of this study was twofold: to examine the mortality experience of older persons admitted to hospital with community acquired pneumonia and to test the hypothesis of whether an association exists between socioeconomic status and mortality subsequent to hospital admission for community-acquired pneumonia.
A population based retrospective cohort study was conducted including all older persons patients admitted to Ontario hospitals with community acquired pneumonia between April 1995 and March 2001. The main outcome measures were 30 day and 1 year mortality subsequent to hospital admission for community-acquired pneumonia.
Socioeconomic status for each patient was imputed from median neighbourhood income. Multivariate analyses were undertaken to adjust for age, sex, co-morbid illness, hospital and physician characteristics. The study sample consisted of 60,457 people. Increasing age, male gender and high co-morbidity increased the risk for mortality at 30 days and one year. Female gender and having a family physician as attending physician reduced mortality risk. The adjusted odds of death after 30-days for the quintiles compared to the lowest income quintile (quintile 1) were 1.02 (95% CI: 0.95-1.09) for quintile 2, 1.04 (95% CI: 0.97-1.12) for quintile 3, 1.01 (95% CI: 0.94-1.08) for quintile 4 and 1.03 (95% CI: 0.96-1.12) for the highest income quintile (quintile 5). For 1 year mortality, compared to the lowest income quintile the adjusted odds ratios were 1.01 (95% CI: 0.96-1.06) for quintile 2, 0.99 (95% CI: 0.94-1.04) for quintile 3, 0.99 (95% CI: 0.93-1.05) for quintile 4 and 1.03 (95% CI: 0.97-1.10) for the highest income quintile.

We investigated how diabetes-associated mortality, disability, early retirement, and work absenteeism impacts workforce participation.
We used the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a national household sample of adults aged 51-61 in 1992, as a data source.
We conducted cross-sectional analyses on the baseline HRS data, and longitudinal analyses using data from eight years of follow-up. We used two-part regression models to estimate the adjusted impact of diabetes on workforce participation, and then estimated the economic impact of diabetes-related losses in productivity.
Diabetes is a significant predictor of lost productivity. The incremental lost income due to diabetes by 1992 was 60.0 billion US dollars over an average diabetes duration of 9.7 years. From 1992 to 2000, diabetes was responsible for 4.4 billion US dollars in lost income due to early retirement, 0.5 billion US dollars due to increased sick days, 31.7 billion US dollars due to disability, and 22.0 US dollars billion in lost income due to premature mortality, for a total of 58.6 billion dollars in lost productivity, or 7.3 billion US dollars per year.
In the U.S. population of adults born between 1931 and 1941, diabetes is associated with a profound negative impact on economic productivity. By 1992, an estimated 60 billion US dollars in lost productivity was associated with diabetes; additional annual losses averaged 7.3 billion US dollars over the next eight years, totaling about 120 billion US dollars by the year 2000. Given the rising prevalence of diabetes, these costs are likely to increase substantially unless countered by better public health or medical interventions.",Diabetes leads to substantial morbidity and premature mortality.,Investigate impact of diabetes on workforce participation and productivity.,"Used Health and Retirement Study data, cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses, two-part regression models.","Diabetes associated with significant productivity losses, totaling billions of dollars annually.","Study focused on economic impact, may not capture all aspects of diabetes-related outcomes."

Results of the baseline and 6 months study were published previously; this paper reports on trends over the full 18 months of follow-up. We analysed changes in income and expenditure and their relationships with morbidity and mortality using multiple regression. Over 2 years, a third of affected households reported at least one death, mainly due to infectious disease. Affected households' real expenditures decreased over time, while real incomes did not, absolutely and relative to unaffected households. Mortality and morbidity independently predicted lower expenditure (adjusted relative expenditure 0.86 and 0.84, respectively), mortality predicted lower income (adjusted relative income 0.80) and higher expenditure predicted less morbidity and mortality (adjusted odds ratios for a US$100 monthly difference 0.78 and 0.65).

It is not known if inequities exist for receipt of investigations used to screen for colorectal cancer (CRC). We examined the association between socioeconomic status and receipt of colorectal investigation in Ontario.
People aged 50 to 70 years living in Ontario on Jan. 1, 1997, who did not have a history of CRC, inflammatory bowel disease or colorectal investigation within the previous 5 years were followed until death or Dec. 31, 2001. Receipt of any colorectal investigation between 1997 and 2001 inclusive was determined by means of linked administrative databases. Income was imputed as the mean household income of the person's census enumeration area. Multivariate analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between the receipt of any colorectal investigation and income.
Of the study cohort of 1,664,188 people, 21.2% received a colorectal investigation in 1997-2001.

The study was conducted as a multilevel Poisson regression analysis, with individuals (n = 1.1 million) as the first level and functional regions of Finland (n = 84) as the second level. The analysis covered men aged 25-64. The data are based on the 1990 census records, which were linked to death records in 1991-1996. The outcome measure was alcohol-related mortality, which was defined using information on the underlying and contributory causes of death. The individual-level covariates included age, education, socioeconomic status, marital status and mother tongue. The area-level variables considered were the proportion of manual workers, unemployment level, median household income, Gini coefficient of income, family cohesion, voting turnout, level of urbanisation and proportion of Swedish-speaking inhabitants. A high proportion of manual workers and of unemployed and low social cohesion (family cohesion and voting turnout) were found to produce adverse effects on alcohol-related mortality, and the independent effects of these variables remained after adjustment for all individual-level and area-level characteristics. The protective effect of high level of urbanisation was revealed after adjustment for other individual- and area-level characteristics. Neither mean income nor income inequality were related to alcohol-related mortality. Adjusting for individual-level variables diminished the average relative deviation of alcohol-related mortality among the functional regions by 41%. The inclusion of area-level characteristics in the model resulted in a total diminution of variation of 79%. The area characteristics considered in this study had a notable effect on alcohol-related mortality, although these effects were smaller than those of the individual-level characteristics.

We hypothesized that surgeons and hospitals with higher caseloads of total shoulder arthroplasties and hemiarthroplasties have better outcomes as measured by decreased mortality rate, shorter length of stay in the hospital, reduced postoperative complications, and routine disposition of patients on discharge.
Data on patients undergoing shoulder arthroplasty were extracted from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample databases for the years 1988 through 2000. Logistic regression with generalized estimating equations and multiple linear regression models were used to estimate the adjusted association between surgeon and hospital volume and outcomes for total shoulder arthroplasty and hemiarthroplasty after adjusting for comorbidity, age, race, household income, and sex.
The mortality rates for patients who had a total shoulder arthroplasty performed by surgeons who did fewer than two procedures per year (0.36%) or who did between two and fewer than four procedures per year (0.32%) were higher than those for patients who had a total shoulder arthroplasty performed by surgeons who did four procedures or more per year (0.20%). The risk-adjusted rate of postoperative complications after hemiarthroplasty was significantly higher for patients managed by surgeons who performed fewer than two procedures per year (1.68%) than for those managed by surgeons with a volume of five procedures or more per year (0.97%). The possibility of postoperative complications when total shoulder arthroplasty was performed in hospitals with a volume of fewer than five procedures (1.44%) or in those with a volume of five to ten procedures per year (1.45%) was significantly higher than that in hospitals where ten procedures or more were performed every year (0.64%). The mean lengths of stay in the hospital after total shoulder arthroplasty and hemiarthroplasty were significantly longer when the operations were performed by surgeons who did fewer than two procedures per year or when they were done in hospitals with a volume of fewer than five procedures per year or with a volume of five to fewer than ten procedures per year than when they were done in hospitals or by surgeons in the highest volume category (p < 0.001).
Patients who have a total shoulder arthroplasty or hemiarthroplasty performed by a high-volume surgeon or in a high-volume hospital are more likely to have a better outcome.

We investigated mortality in relation to neighbourhood levels of income and air pollution in an urban area.
We identified 5228 people in the Hamilton-Burlington area of southern Ontario who had been referred for pulmonary function testing between 1985 and 1999. Nonaccidental deaths that occurred in this group between 1992 and 1999 were ascertained from the Ontario Mortality Registry. Mean household income was estimated by linking the subjects' postal codes with the 1996 census. Mean neighbourhood levels of total suspended particulates and sulfur dioxide were estimated by interpolation from data from a network of sampling stations. We used proportional hazards regression models to compute mortality risk in relation to income and pollutant levels, while adjusting for pulmonary function, body mass index and diagnoses of chronic disease. Household incomes and pollutant levels were each divided into 2 risk categories (low and high) at the median.
Mean pollutant levels tended to be higher in lower-income neighbourhoods. Both income and pollutant levels were associated with mortality differences. Compared with people in the most favourable category (higher incomes and lower particulate levels), those with all other income-particulate combinations had a higher risk of death from nonaccidental causes (lower incomes and higher particulate levels: relative risk [RR] 2.62, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.67-4.13; lower incomes and lower particulate levels: RR 1.82, 95% CI 1.30-2.55; higher incomes and higher particulate levels: RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.12-1.57).

The age adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of death by suicide among 25 to 64 year olds who were unemployed compared with employed were 2.46 (1.10 to 5.49) for women and 2.63 (1.87 to 3.70) for men. Similarly increased odds ratios were observed for the non-active labour force compared with the employed. Strong age only adjusted associations of suicide death with the socioeconomic factors of education (men only), car access, and household income were observed.

In a multivariable model the association of socioeconomic factors with suicide reduced to the null. However, marital status and labour force status remained strong predictors of suicide death. Unemployment was also strongly associated with suicide death among 18-24 year old men. Sensitivity analyses suggested that confounding by mental illness might explain about half, but not all, of the association between unemployment and suicide.

Secondary analysis of the 1993 National Mortality Followback Survey (NMFS), a nationally obtained sample using death certificates and interviews with relatives (proxy respondents) to provide mortality, social, and economic data and information about healthcare utilization in the last year of life for 23,000 deceased individuals.
Hospice care.
Individuals aged 15 and older who died in 1993. Subjects were included in this analysis if they died of nontraumatic causes (N = 11,291).
Hospice use was dichotomized by proxy responses indicating use or nonuse of home or inpatient hospice services. The percentage of individuals using hospice services in the last year of life was calculated.
Unadjusted bivariate results found that African Americans were less likely to use hospice than whites (odds ratio (OR) = 0.59; P <.001) and that those without a living will (LW) (OR = 0.23; P <.001) and without a cancer diagnosis (OR = 0.28; P <.001) were less likely to use hospice. The negative relationship between African Americans and hospice use was unaffected when controlled for sex, education, marital status, existence of a LW, income, and access to health care. Logistic models revealed that presence of a LW diminished the negative relationship between African Americans and hospice use, but the latter remained significant (OR = 0.83; P =.033). A subanalysis of subjects aged 55 and older showed a significant interaction between access to care and race/ethnicity with respect to hospice use (P =.044). Inclusion of income in this multivariable logistic model attenuated the relationship between African-American race/ethnicity and hospice use (OR = 0.77), and the difference between whites and African Americans became only marginally statistically significant (P =.060).
In the 1993 NMFS, hospice use was negatively associated with African-American race/ethnicity independent of income and access to healthcare. The relationship is not independent of age, insurance type, or history of stroke. For subjects aged 55 and older, access to healthcare may be an important confounder of the negative relationship between African-American race/ethnicity and hospice use. Consistent with previous studies, this analysis found that African Americans were less likely to use LWs than whites. The reduced importance of African-American race/ethnicity on hospice use with the inclusion of presence of a LW in logistic models suggests that similar cultural processes may shape differences between African Americans and whites in advance care planning and hospice use.",Racial/ethnic disparities in healthcare exist.,Examine racial/ethnic variations in rates of hospice use and associated factors.,"Secondary analysis of National Mortality Followback Survey data, logistic regression models.","African Americans less likely to use hospice, with socioeconomic factors influencing use.","Study based on survey data, potential biases in self-reported information."

Review of stillbirths and neonatal deaths.
Rural northern Tanzania, Mbulu and Hanang districts.
One hundred and nineteen stillbirth and neonatal deaths identified in a prospective cohort of antenatal attendees and 21 stillbirths and neonatal deaths identified retrospectively in a household survey in seven rural communities.
Verbal autopsy was done to reach a diagnosis, in many cases supplemented with information from antenatal records and hospital records. The avoidability of deaths under the prevailing circumstances was assessed for each case. An account of risk factors detectable at antenatal clinic was done and compared with the woman's recall of the risk assessment and recall of being referred.
Avoidability of stillbirths and neonatal deaths.
There were 60 stillbirths, 49 early neonatal deaths and 27 late neonatal deaths. Infection-related deaths were most common (n = 53), followed by asphyxia-related deaths (n = 32) and immaturity-related deaths (n = 20). Malaria was the most common infectious agent observed (21 children and 20 mothers). Twenty-one deaths (15%) were probably avoidable and 13 (10%) were possibly avoidable. A patient-oriented avoidable factor was identified in 17 (51%) and a provider-oriented avoidable factor was identified in 22 cases (65%). Twenty-six of the 34 avoidable deaths had risk factors, but only two of the women were aware of it and only one recalled being referred to a hospital for the risk factor. There were eight deaths among the 133 mothers who experienced a perinatal death.
Our data indicate that prevention and adequate treatment of infections and asphyxia in the newborn should have high priority in low-income settings. The relatively low proportion of avoidable stillbirths and neonatal deaths may be partly due to accessible emergency obstetric care in the area.

Does mortality from respiratory disease, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) differ with social position measured by education, income, housing and employment grade? The study population consisted of 26,392 males and females from pooling of two population studies in the Copenhagen area. Data was linked with information from social registers in Statistics Denmark. The relationship between socioeconomic factors and risk of death from respiratory disease and COPD was assessed with an average duration of follow-up of 12 yrs. Education was strongly associated with respiratory mortality in both sexes. The association was stronger in later birth cohorts comparing the highest level of education (>11 yrs) with the lowest (<8 yrs). Although smoking rates were inversely associated with the level of education, the social gradient was not affected by adjustment for smoking. In males, but not in females, there was an additional effect of other indicators of social position, i.e. employment grade (white collar versus blue collar), household income, housing conditions (less than one person per room versus more), and cohabitation (cohabiting versus living alone). Similar results were found for mortality from COPD. The results confirm the existence of a strong social gradient in respiratory mortality and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which is independent of smoking and is stronger in males. Social disadvantage is a potentially avoidable cause of death from respiratory disease and further research is needed to explain the excess risk in the socioeconomically disadvantaged.",Social differences impact respiratory diseases.,Examine mortality from respiratory disease in relation to social position.,"Study in Copenhagen area, analysis of mortality rates by socioeconomic factors.","Social gradient in respiratory mortality, with socioeconomic disparities influencing outcomes.","Study conducted in specific region, findings may not represent national trends."

Sickness absence is twice as high as in other occupations. Disability pensions for musculoskeletal disorders are twice as high in cleaners as in other employed women. However, a result from Norwegian and Danish studies shows that female cleaners do not report higher morbidity of musculoskeletal disorders than other women. The objective was to analyse whether female cleaners have a higher risk of obtaining a disability pension than women in other unskilled occupations and whether the length of employment influences the risk.
The material is from the National Census in 1980 and 1990 and supplemented with disability pensioning data from the National Insurance Administration and the Population registry. Women aged 20-49, working as cleaners, seamstresses, nursing, kitchen, or shop assistants in 1980 were followed until 1990 or until receiving disability pension. Female cleaners aged 30-59 years in 1990 were categorized into two cohorts by occupation in 1980. They were followed from 1991 to 1994, to the date they died, or received disability pension. Incidence rates and incidence rate ratio for disability pension and mortality was calculated by Poisson regression. Cox regression calculated the relative risk of obtaining disability pension.
Disability pension rates were higher among cleaners than among other women in unskilled occupations (1.4 per 1,000 person years (CI 95% 1.35-1.46)), but the risk of obtaining disability pension did not increase with increasing exposure to cleaning (HR 0.8 (CI 95% 0.6-1.2)).
The cleaning occupation has high disability rates compared with other unskilled occupations.

The occurrence of hospital-reported medical errors.
The national rate of hospital-reported medical errors in hospitalized children ranged from 1.81 to 2.96 per 100 discharges. These medical error rates were statistically lower in 1988, with the years 1991, 1994, and 1997 not being statistically different from each other. There were no consistent differences in the rates of medical errors when stratified by gender, race, payor status, or median household income of the patient's zip code across years. There was, however, a statistically significant relationship between higher median household income and increasing medical error rates; this trend was consistent across all 4 years. Similarly, children with special medical needs or dependence on a medical technology also had significantly higher rates of hospital-reported medical errors. Although hospital size did not seem to be related to the rate of medical errors, private for-profit hospitals consistently reported lower rates, whereas urban teaching hospitals in all years but 1997 reported higher rates of medical errors.
These data highlight both the strengths and limitations of administrative data in the investigation of medical errors.

This study on myocardial infarction sought to explore whether the socio-economic pattern of disease has any relationship with obesity.
In the cohort are 20,099 middle-aged men of whom 9,150 were manual and 9,190 nonmanual workers and 1,759 were self-employed. A total of 4,081 were single, 16,018 cohabiting. The body mass index (BMI) cut-off values for overweight and obesity were 25-30 and >/=30 kg m-2, respectively. Local and national registers were used to monitor incidence of events over 18 years.
Obesity was associated with an increased incidence of coronary events and deaths in each occupational group. Being single significantly increased the risk associated with obesity. After stratification for civil status the risk associated with obesity was limited to those who were single and who either had a blue-collar job or were self-employed. The multivariate-adjusted relative risk (RR) of coronary events and deaths in obese manual workers who were single was 1.91 (95% confidence interval: 1.21-3.02) and 2.54 (1.74-3.69), respectively, times higher than it was amongst those who were cohabiting. Amongst those who were self-employed, the corresponding age-adjusted RRs were 4.79 (1.69-13.57) and 3.80 (1.62-8.93).
Adjusted for lifestyle and biological risk factors, the increased risk of coronary events and death for obese men with manual jobs was applicable only to those who were single. It is concluded that being single significantly increases the cardiovascular risk associated with obesity.",,,,,

Manual origins and poor care in childhood remained associated with mortality even after adjusting for social class in adulthood or home ownership. The hazard ratio was 2.6 (95% confidence interval 1.5 to 4.4) for those living in manual households as children and as adults compared with those living in non-manual households at both life stages.

A representative probability sample of Australian households (part of the 1995 National Health Survey). Data were collected by face-to-face interviews. Socio-economic position was measured using occupation and family income. Participants comprised 9,577 Australian-born males and females aged 20-24 (n = 3,186), 25-29 (n = 3,184), and 30-34 (n = 3,207). Height was self-reported and operationalised in terms of mean height and 'short' stature (defined as 1 SD below mean height for each sex-age subgroup).
Graded, positive associations were found between occupation, family income, and height for males and females in each age cohort. Among males, mean height differences between blue-collar employees and professionals were 1.1 cm to 1.5 cm (depending on age-cohort), and for females, 1.6 cm to 2.1 cm. The corresponding height differences for males and females living in the least and most affluent families were 1.6 cm to 2.3 cm, and 1.0 cm to 2.5 cm, respectively. Persons in blue-collar jobs and those in low-income families were more likely to be classified as 'short'.
Estimates of mortality risk associated with short stature suggest that these height differences translate to about a 2-5% increased risk of death for the most disadvantaged groups. Given that socioeconomic height differences in adulthood have their genesis in the formative stages of biological and social development, public health intervention efforts need to focus on early life exposures and environments. The greatest reduction in height inequalities, and by extension health inequalities, is likely to flow from macro-level public policies to alleviate poverty and minimise the social and economic divide.",,,,,

The main question posed is whether there is any continuing social effect of birth order when (a) biological factors at birth, (b) other social factors at birth and (c) socio-economic circumstances in adulthood are adjusted for. The analyses are based on the Uppsala Birth Cohort Study consisting of all 14,192 boys and girls who were born alive at the Uppsala Academic Hospital in Sweden during the period 1915-9. The results showed that all-cause mortality differed according to birth order in all of the four studied age intervals when birth year, mother's age, birth weight, gestational age, diseases of mother, diseases of the infant, social class and mother's marital status at the time of childbirth were adjusted for. The general tendency was for laterborn siblings, particularly girls women, to demonstrate a higher mortality risk than firstborn children. However, in the oldest age group (55-80 years) the previously significant association between birth order and male mortality became insignificant when adult socio-economic circumstances were controlled for. This indicates that the long-term influence of childhood birth order position on mortality is partly mediated by adult social class, education and income. The concluding section of the paper notes that laterborn children, and especially girls, were a disadvantaged group in early 20th century Sweden. Thus, for the subjects in the present study, the childhood social conditions linked to birth order position seem to have had consequences for these individuals' health and survival that extend over the whole life-course.",Birth order may influence mortality rates.,Does birth order affect mortality rates across different life stages?,Analysis of Uppsala Birth Cohort Study data on mortality by birth order.,"Laterborn siblings, particularly girls, had higher mortality risk, partly mediated by adult social class.","Potential confounding factors not fully controlled for, generalizability to other populations may be limited."

Mortality records for 1991-94 were anonymously and probabilistically linked to 1991 census records, thereby creating a cohort study of all New Zealand census respondents. Odds ratios of mortality comparing categories of each socio-economic factor were calculated using logistic regression. For income, education and deprivation (NZDep91) a modified relative index of inequality (RII(10:90)) was calculated. The RII(10:90) estimates the relative risk of mortality for low socio-economic people (10th percentile rank) compared to high socio-economic people (90 percentile rank) allowing direct comparisons across socio-economic factors.
The relative risk of all-cause mortality for 25-64 year old males with an equivalised household income less than $20,000, compared to greater than $50,000, was 2.16 (95% confidence interval 1.99 to 2.34). For females, this relative risk was 1.68 (1.52 to 1.86). Using the RII(10:90) all-cause mortality was 2.22, 1.94 and 1.58 times greater among low compared to high socio-economic males for income, NZDep91 and education, respectively. For females, these RII(10:90) estimates were 1.77, 1.69 and 1.57, respectively.

Prospective study of mortality in Finland among all men and women over 30 years old. Information on household income and sociodemographic factors was from the records of the Finnish tax authorities and the 1990 census. Income data were available for more than 95% of the cohort. Follow-up was by record linkage to death certificates in 1991-1996; altogether about 261 000 deaths.
The all-cause mortality ratio between the lowest and the highest household income decile is 2.37 (95% CI : 2.30-2.44) among men and 1.73 (95% CI : 1.67-1.80) among women. Adjusting for household structure, spouse's economic activity, social class, education and own economic activity attenuates the relationship by 61% among men and 52% among women. The association between income and mortality is mainly linear before and after adjusting for confounding, and the association is strong for all 5-year age groups below 60-64 years, after which it declines rapidly in strength.
The mainly linear nature of the relationship and the strong attenuation after adjustment for other socioeconomic factors and economic activity status, and the age pattern of the relationship indicate that a large part of the relationship is unlikely to be due to direct causal effects of poverty and material hardship. Rather, income seems to be related to accumulation of factors that increase mortality over the whole range of incomes.",Household income is linked to mortality.,Is there a linear relationship between household income and mortality?,Prospective study in Finland analyzing income and mortality data.,"Linear association between income and mortality, with strong attenuation after adjusting for confounders.","Possible unmeasured confounders, findings may not apply to all age groups."

We studied men in a subset analysis within a longitudinal, observational cohort of patients with metastatic prostate cancer at the University of California, Los Angeles, Center for Health Sciences. The analysis included 23 patients who died and had submitted at least two health-related quality-of-life surveys in the final months before death. The outcomes were measured with the RAND 36-Item Health Survey, an established, validated instrument that includes physical and emotional domains. To gauge the effect of marital status, education, and income, we dichotomized these demographic variables.
Most domains showed declines, many of them substantial. Patients who had a slower rate of decline in the physical domains tended to be married, better educated, and more affluent. We noted a trend toward a slower deterioration in the mental composite scores among patients who had less than a college degree and an annual household income of $30,000 or less.

Age standardised mortality was highest in the parishes with the least equal income distribution. After adjustment for individual risk factors, parish income inequality was not associated with mortality, whereas individual household income was. Thus, individuals in the highest income quarter had lower mortality than those in the lowest quarter (adjusted hazard ratio for men 0.51 (95% confidence interval 0.45 to 0.59) and for women 0.60 (0.54 to 0.68)).

In a prospective cohort study, we followed 1,935 patients hospitalized with a confirmed acute myocardial infarction at 45 U.S. medical centers between 1989 and 1993, as part of the Determinants of Myocardial Infarction Onset Study. Trained interviewers performed chart reviews and face-to-face interviews with all patients. We analyzed survival using Cox proportional hazards regression to control for potentially confounding factors.
Of the 1,935 patients, 320 (17%) died during a mean follow-up of 3.7 years. A total of 399 patients (21%) had previously diagnosed diabetes. Diabetes was associated with markedly higher total mortality in unadjusted (hazard ratio [HR] 2.4; 95% CI 1.9-3.0) and adjusted (1.7; 1.3-2.1) analyses. The magnitude of the effect of diabetes was identical to that of a previous myocardial infarction.

Prospective cohort study.
All adult deaths from cancer in Connecticut during 1994.
Six thousand eight hundred and thirteen individuals who met all of the following criteria: died of a cancer-related cause in 1994, had previously been diagnosed with cancer in Connecticut, and were age 18 and older at the time of death.
Site of death.
Twenty-nine percent of the study sample died at home, 42% died in a hospital, 17% died in a nursing home, and 11% died in an inpatient hospice facility. Multivariate analysis indicated that demographic characteristics (being married, female, white, and residing in a higher income area), disease-related factors (type of cancer, longer survival postdiagnosis), and health-resource factors (greater availability of hospice providers, less availability of hospital beds) were associated with dying at home rather than in a hospital or inpatient hospice.
The implications of this study for clinical practice and health planning are considerable. The findings identify groups (men, unmarried individuals, and those living in lower income areas) at higher risk for institutionalized death-groups that may be targeted for possible interventions to promote home death when home death is preferred by patients and their families. Further, the findings suggest that site of death is influenced by available health-system resources. Thus, if home death is to be supported, the relative availability of hospital beds and hospice providers may be an effective policy tool for promoting home death.",Demographic and health-resource factors influence home death in cancer patients.,What factors are associated with dying at home among individuals with cancer?,Prospective cohort study of cancer deaths in Connecticut.,"Demographic characteristics, disease-related factors, and health-resource factors influence site of death.","Potential selection bias, findings may not generalize to all cancer populations."

Using data from the U.S. Renal Data System, we performed a retrospective cohort study of 8481 patients who were or who were not treated by long-term dialysis before receiving a kidney transplant from a living donor. The relative rate of allograft failure for patients who received a transplant without previously undergoing long-term dialysis, as compared with patients who underwent long-term dialysis before transplantation, was assessed by proportional-hazards analysis, with adjustment for potential confounding variables, including the transplantation center and median household income. The association between the receipt of a kidney transplant from a living donor without previous dialysis (""preemptive transplantation"") and the risk of biopsy-confirmed acute rejection within six months after transplantation was evaluated by conditional logistic-regression analysis, with adjustment for the transplantation center.
Transplantation of a kidney from a living donor without previous long-term dialysis was associated with a 52 percent reduction in the risk of allograft failure during the first year after transplantation (rate ratio, 0.48; P=0.002), an 82 percent reduction during the second year (rate ratio, 0.18; P=0.001), and an 86 percent reduction during subsequent years (rate ratio, 0.14; P=0.001), as compared with transplantation after dialysis. The reduction in the rate of allograft failure during the first year was attenuated when adjustment was made for the timing of acute rejection within the first year (rate ratio, 0.69; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.44 to 1.10; P=0.10). Increasing duration of dialysis was associated with increasing odds of rejection within six months after transplantation (P=0.001).

Effectiveness was operationalized as two outcomes within 5 years of the diagnosis of breast cancer: the probability of mastectomy-free survival (either death or mastectomy count as event, whichever comes first), and the probability of mastectomy conditional on survival (mastectomy counts as event, observations censored at death).
We linked records of 46,687 new cases of breast cancer from 1982 to 1991 in the Ontario Cancer Registry to records of surgery from 1982 to 1995, radiotherapy (RT) from 1982 to 1992, and median household income from the 1986 census. We labeled breast surgery within 4 months and postoperative RT within 12 months of diagnosis as treatment for newly diagnosed breast cancer. Surgery was categorized as mastectomy, lumpectomy plus RT, lumpectomy alone, or no surgical procedure. Among cases that did not undergo mastectomy within 4 months of diagnosis, we labeled mastectomy subsequent to 4 months after diagnosis as treatment failure. We performed life-table analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression, to describe the probability of mastectomy conditional on survival and the probability of mastectomy-free survival.
A total of 16,279 cases underwent lumpectomy as the maximum procedure on the breast within 4 months of diagnosis, and 49.7% of these received postoperative RT. Compared to the provincial mean, regions with higher rates of lumpectomy plus RT have higher probability of mastectomy-free survival and lower probability of mastectomy conditional upon survival 5 years after diagnosis of breast cancer.

They comprised all identified infants born in Jimma town, south-west Ethiopia, in the year starting 1 Meskren 1985 in the Ethiopian calendar (11 September 1992). Growth in infancy is poor in this town, as it is in Ethiopia more generally: mean z-scores for both weight and length were more than 1.5 SD below the median of the NCHS/WHO reference population by 1 year of age, and infant mortality was 115/1000. In this paper we examine the weight gain of singletons in relation to background variables and to traditional nutritional and surgical practices in the families. Confirming work in other areas, sanitation, water supply, the income of the family and the mother's literacy were important determinants of weight gain. Almost all the infants were initially breast fed, and about 80% were still breast fed at 1 year. Many were also given cows' milk from 4 months onwards. Breast feeding had beneficial effects up to 8 months of age, and cows' milk had beneficial effects after 6 months of age. Supplementary feeds of solids and semi-solids were given at appropriate ages, but had no detectable benefit. Water was given inappropriately early, but did no detectable harm. Episodes of diarrhoea, fever or persistent cough each reduced weight gain. Catch-up in weight then took up to 8 months, probably because of the poor nutritional quality of supplementary feeds. The incidences of local traditional operations in the first year were: circumcision 63% in males and 4% in females, uvulectomy 35% and the extraction of milk teeth 38%. Although circumcision had no detectable adverse effect on weight, uvulectomy and milk teeth extraction both reduced weight gain.
The effect of family-level activities on growth in infancy was examined by looking into traditional nutritional and surgical practices in Ethiopia. The subjects were 1563 infants born in Jimma, southwest Ethiopia between 11 September 1992 and 10 September 1993. Prior to birth, pregnant women were identified through a network of traditional birth attendants (TBAs). The TBAs worked closely with the project interviewer in gathering information from pregnancy until birth. Details of the sample size at different ages, of the actual ages at which infants were weighed and of known deaths are presented. It was found that the level of infants' weight gain over the first year was related to environmental and familial background. Environmental factors cited include sanitation and water supply. Family income and the level of the mother's literacy were important determinants of weight gain. A big majority of the infants were initially breast-fed, and about 80% were still breast-fed at 1 year. Infant nutrition was supplemented by cow's milk from 4 months onward. In addition, supplementary feedings of solid and semisolid foods were given at appropriate ages, but had no evident benefit. Ailments such as diarrhea, fever and persistent cough slowed down growth, but eventually weight increased at age 8 months.

To conduct a historical cohort study that uses maternal demographic characteristics to identify young children at high risk of fire-related deaths, thus defining appropriate targets for prevention programs.
The cohort consisted of children born to mothers who resided in the state of Tennessee between 1980 and 1995. Information was obtained by linking birth certificates, 1990 census data, and death certificates. Children were eligible for the study if they were <5 years of age at any time within the study period and if key study variables were present (99.2% of births). Birth certificates provided information on maternal characteristics including age, race, education, previous live births, use of prenatal care, and residence (in standard metropolitan statistical area). Child characteristics included gender, gestational age, and birth type (singleton/multiple gestation). Neighborhood income was estimated by linking the mother's address at the time of birth to the 1990 census (block group mean per capita income). The study outcome was a fire resulting in at least one fatality (fatal fire event) during the study period, identified from death certificates (coded E880 through E889 in the International Classification of Diseases, 9th rev). We calculated the fatal fire event rate corresponding to each stratum of maternal/child characteristics. We assessed the independent association between each characteristic and the risk of a fatal fire event from a Poisson regression multivariate analysis.
During the study period, 1 428 694 children contributed 5 415 213 child years to the cohort: there were 270 deaths from fire (4.99 deaths per 100 000 child years) and 231 fatal fire events. In the multivariate analysis, factors associated with greater than a threefold increase in fatal fire events included maternal education, age, and number of other children. Compared with children whose mothers had a college education, children whose mothers had less than a high school education had 19.4 times (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.6-142.4) an increased risk of a fatal fire event. Children whose mothers had more than two other children had 6.1 times (95% CI, 3.8-9.8) an increased risk of a fatal fire event compared with children whose mothers had no other children. Children of mothers <20 years of age had 3.9 times (95% CI, 2.2-7.1) increased risk of a fatal fire event compared with children whose mothers were >/=30 years old. Although both maternal neighborhood income and race were associated strongly with increased rates of fatal fire events in the univariate analysis, this association did not persist in the multivariate analysis. Other factors that were associated with increased risk of fatal fire events in the multivariate analysis were male gender and having a mother who was unmarried or who had delayed prenatal care. The three factors associated most strongly with fire mortality were combined to create a risk score based on maternal education (>/=16 years, 0 points; 13 to 15 years, 1 point; 12 years, 2 points; <12 years, 3 points); age (>/=30 years, 0 points; 25 to 29 years, 1 point; 20 to 24 years, 2 points; <20 years, 3 points); and number of other children (none, 0 points; one, 1 point; two, 2 points; three or more, 3 points). The lowest-risk group (score <3) included 19% of the population and had 0.19 fatal fire events per 100 000 child years. In contrast, highest-risk children (score >7) comprised 1.5% of the population and had 28.6 fatal fire events per 100 000 child years, 150 times higher than low-risk children. Children with risk scores >5 contributed 26% of child years but experienced 68% of all fatal fire events.

Prospective OHCA data were collected over 4 years (1991-1994) from a convenience sample of OHCA patients transported to nine hospitals in three suburban counties. Race was determined from hospital and vital statistics records. The average household income was identified from ZIP codes and used as a marker of socioeconomic status. Demographic data and known predictors of survival were compared between blacks and whites. A logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between race, income, and survival.
Of the 1,690 patients, 223 (13%) were blacks and 1,467 (87%) were whites. Average household income was less for blacks than for whites ($40,225 versus $46,193; P < .001), but both populations were affluent by national standards (national percentile ranks were 73% and 88%, respectively). The populations were no different in percentage of witnessed arrests (57% versus 61%; P = .465).

Twelve villages in Pondicherry with a population of 16,803.
Prospective study.
A birth cohort of 356 live births (LB) born between January 1st and December 31st 1988.
The live births were followed-up from birth to five years age (1988-1993). The health care received by this cohort and the antenatal services received by the cohort mothers was reviewed. Outcome measures related to child survival were determined and their changing trend since 1967 was examined.
Fifty-four per cent of the cohort children were from families below the poverty line. Antenatal registration and tetanus immunization coverage of the mothers of the cohort was 100%. Immunization coverage of the cohort children was more than 98% for BCG, DPT (three doses) and OPV (three doses) and 82% for measles. The infant mortality rate had reduced from 201/1000 LB in 1967 to 64/1000 LB (95% CI 58.9-68.1) in 1989. The child death rate decreased from 29.4/1000 children 1-4 years of age (1970) to 18/1000 (95% CI 13.9-22.1) in 1992. There were no deaths due to neonatal tetanus or measles. Neonatal mortality (35/1000 LB; 95% CI 29.9-40.1) was higher than the post-neonatal mortality (29/1000 LB; 95% CI 24.1-33.9). Fifty eight per cent of the neonatal deaths were due to non-infective causes like prematurity, birth asphyxia, birth injuries and congenital anomalies. Eighty per cent of post neonatal deaths were due to infections. Overall, the child survival index was high (91.27%; 95% CI 88.14-94.26). This was inspite of the low socio-economic background of the children's families.
Good MCH services can substantially improve child survival inspite of prevailing low socio-economic situations. Inputs for neonatal care need to be strengthened to further enhance child survival.
A cohort of 356 live births (LBs) in 12 villages in Pondicherry during 1988 was followed from birth to age 5 years to determine the impact of maternal and child health (MCH) services upon child survival in a low income, rural community. 54% of the children were from families living in poverty. All mothers of the cohort were registered antenatally and immunized against tetanus, and more than 98% of the children had been immunized with BCG, DPT (3 doses), and OPV (3 doses). 82% of the children were immunized against measles. The infant mortality rate declined from 201/1000 LBs in 1967 to 64/1000 in 1989, while the child death rate decreased from 29.4/1000 children aged 1-4 years in 1970 to 18/1000 in 1992. No death occurred due to neonatal tetanus or measles. Levels of neonatal and post-neonatal mortality were 35/1000 LBs and 29/1000, respectively. 58% of the neonatal deaths were due to non-infective causes such as prematurity, birth asphyxia, birth injuries, and congenital anomalies, while 80% of post-neonatal deaths were due to infections. The child survival index was 91.27%. These findings demonstrate how the provision of good MCH services can improve child survival in low income populations.",,,,,

The objective of this study was to describe age-specific socioeconomic differentials in mortality and morbidity for a representative sample of a single Canadian province. The study sample was formed from the linkage of individual respondent records in the 1986 census to vital statistics records and comprehensive records of health care utilization for a 5% sample of residents of the province of Manitoba. Using two measures of socioeconomic status derived from census responses, attained education and household income, individuals were stratified into age-specific quartile ranks. Based on diagnostic information contained on health care utilization records, the proportion of the sample in treatment during a 12-month observation period was calculated for 15 broadly defined categories of morbidity and tested for differences across socioeconomic quartiles. Mortality was inversely associated with both income and education quartile rank. In the analysis of morbidity, no association between socioeconomic status and treatment prevalence was observed in the majority, no association between socioeconomic status and treatment prevalence was observed in the majority of the 122 age- and disorder-specific strata tested. Of the observed associations, however, negative relationships were dominant, indicating a higher treatment prevalence among individuals of lower attained education or lower household income. Across the age course, negative relationships were most frequently present among young and middle aged adults, those aged 30-64, and were more consistently found for income than for education. The general findings of this study of a representative Canadian population support observations from other developed country settings that socioeconomic differences in relative rates of mortality and morbidity over the life course are greatest in the adult years.",,,,,

Reports for other developing countries indicate that persistent diarrhoea is emerging as an important cause of mortality and morbidity in this age group. Little is, however, known about the extent of the condition in our setting. The socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of children with persistent diarrhoea seen at a teaching hospital in Addis Ababa over an 18-month period is presented. Of 5,762 children with all forms of diarrhoea seen during the study period 264 (5%) had persistent diarrhoea. Most of the children (83%) were below 18 months of age and the peak occurrence was between the ages of seven and 12 months. The majority (86%) of the patients had associated malnutrition and 83% of the infants under four months of age were either fully or partially weaned. Watery diarrhoea with no dehydration was the main clinical feature. Nearly 7% of the patients had dysentery. Average family income was low and parental literacy level seem to have had no effect. It is suggested that breastfeeding and appropriate weaning practices be strongly promoted. Further work is proposed in order to determine the magnitude of the problem and identify the risk factors associated with the disease, including the unfavourable child and family unit characteristics and care seeking behaviours.
The sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the 264 children with persistent diarrhea presenting to the Ethio-Swedish Children's Hospital in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in an 18-month period (1992-93) were investigated. The children with persistent diarrhea had an episode lasting at least 14 days and represented 5% of all children with diarrhea seen during the study period. 71% had watery diarrhea. 83% of children with persistent diarrhea were under 18 months of age; occurrence peaked at ages 7-12 months. 83% of affected infants under 4 months of age were fully or partially weaned. 16% were dehydrated and 66% were malnourished. The majority of children were from low-income families; 28% reported no income and 32% had an annual income under US$300. 27% of mothers of children with persistent diarrhea were illiterate, 31% had an elementary school education, and 42% had a secondary education. More information is needed on characteristics of children with diarrhea and their families, health care-seeking behaviors, and the time and money costs associated with care seeking. Also required, to prevent infantile diarrhea associated with contaminated milk or water, is promotion of breast feeding and appropriate weaning practices.",,,,,

A nationally representative sample of 14,407 people aged 25-74 years in the United States from the first national health and nutrition examination survey.
Subjects were followed from initial interview in 1971-5 until 1987. Complete follow up information was available for 92.2% of the sample.
Relation between both household income and income inequality in community of residence and individual all cause mortality at follow up was examined with Cox proportional hazards survival analysis.
Community income inequality showed a significant association with subsequent community mortality, and with individual mortality after adjustment for age, sex, and mean income in the community of residence. After adjustment for individual household income, however, the association with mortality was lost.

This article describes the results of the investigation whether there are systematic differences in socio-economic and health-related factors between participants in a follow up study and those who are lost to follow-up. Subjects included were 1,030 men and 957 women aged 55-74 who participated in the second MONICA Survey Augsburg, F.R.G., 1989/90 (MONICA = Monitoring of trends and determinants of cardiovascular disease). They were reexamined in 1994-95. In 1994/95 910 men and 912 women of the baseline study were still alive, 1305 persons (663 men, 642 women) took part in the follow up by telephone. Altogether 120 men and 45 women had died since 1989/90. 144 persons were not eligible for the study (15 moved away, 5 severely ill persons, 124 without telephone). 373 persons were classified as eligible non-responders. The response rate was 77.8% concerning 1678 eligible persons (men 79.1%, women 76.4%). Non-response has led to an underrepresentation of the lower social class (workers, less than 10 years of education; household income less than 1500 DM) and of persons living alone (single, divorced, widowed; single-person households). In females, non-responders were overrepresented by ""never employed persons"" (odds ratio 3.02; 1.89-4.85). We found that the odds of being non-responder for single, divorced or widowed men was 3.40 (95 %-CI: 2.20-5.23) compared to married men. Men ""without chronic diseases"" at the baseline study compared with ill men had an odds for non-response of 1.54 (95%-CI: 1.00-2.37); the odds was 1.38 (95%-CI: 1.02-1.85) among women who had described their health status as ""not so good/bad"" in comparison with women with good self reported health. The reported distortions by non-response could be important in analyses of social conditions of morbidity and mortality. The underrepresentation of men without chronic diseases and women with bad self-assessment of their health is relevant for the estimates of morbidity as health outcome.

To identify and analyze predictors and consequences of nonadherence to antituberculosis treatment.
Retrospective study of a citywide cohort of 184 patients with tuberculosis in New York City, newly diagnosed by culture in April 1991-before the strengthening of its control program-and followed up through 1994. Follow-up information was collected through the New York City tuberculosis registry. Nonadherence was defined as treatment default for at least 2 months.
Eighty-eight of the 184 (48%) patients were nonadherent. Greater nonadherence was noted among blacks (unadjusted relative risk [RR] 3.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1 to 8.6, compared with whites), injection drug users (RR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.0), homeless (RR 1.4, 95% CI 1.0 to 1.8), alcoholics (RR 1.4, 95% CI 1.0 to 1.9), and HIV-infected patients (RR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.9); also, census-derived estimates of household income were lower among nonadherent patients (P = 0.018). In multivariate analysis, only injection drug use and homelessness predicted nonadherence, yet 46 (39%) of 117 patients who were neither homeless nor drug users were nonadherent. Nonadherent patients took longer to convert to negative culture (254 versus 64 days, P < 0.001), were more likely to acquire drug resistance (RR 5.6, 95% CI 0.7 to 44.2), required longer treatment regimens (560 versus 324 days, P < 0.0001), and were less likely to complete treatment (RR 0.5, 95% CI 0.4 to 0.7). There was no association between treatment adherence and all-cause mortality.
In the absence of public health intervention, half the patients defaulted treatment for 2 months or longer. Although common among the homeless and injection drug users, the problem occurred frequently and unpredictably in other patients. Nonadherence may contribute to the spread of tuberculosis and the emergence of drug resistance, and may increase the cost of treatment. These data lend support to directly observed therapy in tuberculosis.",Poor adherence to tuberculosis treatment is a barrier to control.,Predictors and consequences of nonadherence to tuberculosis treatment.,"Retrospective study of 184 tuberculosis patients in New York City, analyzing adherence and outcomes.","Nonadherence was higher among certain groups like blacks, injection drug users, and homeless individuals, leading to treatment delays and resistance.",Nonadherence may contribute to spread of tuberculosis and increase treatment costs.

We contrasted the characteristics of patients who depend on emergency department (ED) care for the management of their asthma exacerbations to the characteristics of patients employing self-management plans in an ambulatory setting.
In prospective fashion, we used a structured interview and charted information to survey two cohorts of patients suffering from an acute exacerbation of asthma; those seen in a hospital ED (n = 80) and those seen in an ambulatory asthma care facility (Asthma Center [AC]) (n = 40) at the same hospital. We looked for differences in socioeconomic characteristics, asthma severity, asthma knowledge, and asthma self-management skills between groups.
There were no significant differences in mean age (SD) (ED vs AC: 36.65 [13.8] vs 40 [13.8] years) or female to male ratio (ED vs AC: 2/1 vs 2.5/1) between the two groups. There were no major differences in ethnic origin, educational status, marital status, smoking history, employment status, number of children in the household, possession of an extended health insurance plan, sick leave benefits, and child care availability between the two groups. Patients seeking ED care were more likely to have resided in the city for < 5 years (34% vs 8%; p < 0.05), and more likely to be living alone (35% vs 15%; p < 0.05). Significantly more patients from the ED group had a below average gross annual income (55% vs 3%; p < 0.05). There were several significant differences between groups in their knowledge of asthma and its therapy. Most striking, 79% of AC patients reported having a predetermined crisis plan vs just 23% of ED patients (p < 0.001). Although measurements of airflow (percent predicted FEV1) were significantly lower in the ED group than the AC group (mean, 50% vs 78.4%; p < 0.001), other indexes reflecting the degree of asthma severity over the long term such as past use of oral steroids, history of hospitalization, or ICU admission for asthma and the mean total days of disability within the preceding year were not significantly different between the two groups. Most of the ED patients had more than one previous visit to the ED for asthma exacerbation within the preceding year while most exacerbations of AC patients had been treated in the ambulatory care setting. Only 17% of ED patients initiated or increased inhaled or oral steroids before seeking medical care vs 89% of AC patients (p < 0.001).
We conclude that a subgroup of asthmatics depends primarily on crisis-oriented care for the management of asthma. These patients are more likely to have lower income, to live alone, and to have resided at their current address for less time than patients seeking less urgent ambulatory care. Moreover, such patients are less knowledgeable about asthma and its management and are less likely to have a predetermined crisis plan.",Crisis-oriented care for asthma may worsen outcomes.,Comparison of characteristics between emergency department and ambulatory care asthma patients.,Prospective study comparing 80 ED and 40 ambulatory asthma patients in New York City.,"ED patients had lower income, were more likely to live alone, and had poorer asthma knowledge and self-management skills.",Study focused on a single center and may not be generalizable.

We investigated the association between selected religious groups and all-cause mortality in 1627 eastern Finnish men aged 42-60 years during 1984-1989 as a part of the Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study (KIHD).
Eastern Orthodox men had a 5.1-fold (95% confidence interval [Cl: 1.98-13.3, P < 0.001) mortality as compared with Lutheran men after adjusting for main confounders. Adjustment for different sets of covariates did not affect the magnitude of relative hazard (RH) notably. Adjusted for the examination year, age, family history of coronary heart disease (CHD), and ischaemia in exercise electrocardiograms, RH was 4.4 (95% CI: 2.5-7.5, P < 0.001) and 4.7 (95% CI: 2.7-8.3, P < 0.001) after an additional adjustment for serum cholesterol, blood leucocytes, plasma fibrinogen, serum triglycerides, maximal oxygen uptake, height, and weight. With adjustment for income, childhood socioeconomic status (SES), and years of education RH for the Orthodox religion was 4.2 (95% CI: 2.4-7.3, P < 0.001) and 4.4 (95% CI: 2.5-7.7; P < 0.001) with depression, helplessness, quality of relationships, marital status and organizational participation, and 4.1 (95% CI: 2.4-7.2, P < 0.001) when adjusted for the use of tobacco and alcohol and the intensity of physical activity. After adjustment for migration because of the war the RH was 4.5 (95% CI: 1.9-10.8, P < 0.001).

Study patients included 159 patients with CAP, 57 (36%) initially hospitalized, who were identified as being at low risk for early mortality using a validated prediction model. Subjects were enrolled from university and community health care facilities located in Boston, Mass, Halifax, Nova Scotia, and Pittsburgh, Pa, participating in the Pneumonia Patient Outcome Research Team prospective cohort study of CAP. Three utility assessment techniques (category scaling, standard gamble, and willingness to pay) were used to measure the strength of patient preferences for the site of care for low-risk CAP. At the time of initial therapy or during the early recuperative period, patient preferences were assessed across a spectrum of potential clinical outcomes using 7 standardized pneumonia clinical vignettes.
Responses to the 7 pneumonia scenarios indicated that most patients consistently preferred outpatient-based therapy. This pattern was observed regardless of whether patients had actually been treated initially at home or in a hospital. Patients (74%) who stated that they generally preferred home care for low-risk CAP were willing to pay a mean of 24% of 1 month's household income to be assured of this preference. Preference for home care, as measured by the category scaling and the willingness to pay, persisted after adjustment for sociodemographic and baseline health status covariates. Sixty nine percent of interviewed patients said that their physician alone determined whether they would be treated in the hospital or at home. Only 11% recalled being asked if they had a preference for either site of care.
Most patients, even those treated initially in a hospital, who were at low risk for mortality from CAP prefer outpatient treatment. However, most physicians appear not to involve patients in the site-of-care decision.

The 2937 deaths that occurred over the 16-year follow-up period were grouped into specific causes and related to median Black family income.
There was an inverse association between age-adjusted all-cause mortality and median family income. There was no attenuation of this association over the follow-up period, and the association was similar for the 22 clinical centers carrying out the screening.

For 300 685 White men screened for the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial between 1973 and 1975, data were collected on median income of White households in the zip code of residence, age, cigarette smoking, blood pressure, serum cholesterol, previous myocardial infarction, and drug treatment for diabetes. The 31 737 deaths that occurred over the 16-year follow-up period were grouped into specific causes and related to median White family income.
There was an inverse association between age- adjusted all-cause mortality and median family income. There was no attenuation of this association over the follow-up period, and the association was similar for the 22 clinical centers carrying out the screening. The gradient was seen for many-but not all-of the specific causes of death. Other risk factors accounted for some of the association between income and coronary heart disease and smoking-related cancers.

Mortality increased among under-5-year-olds from 1987 (211 per 1000) to 1988 (323 per 1000) to 1989 (414 per 1000). The mortality risk was more pronounced for boys than girls and was more so for infants than children aged 1-4 years. The major signs prior to death were respiratory infections, diarrhoeal diseases, fever/malaria and tetanus in the neonatal period. Over the 3-year study period mortality rates for diarrhoeal diseases increased significantly, while those for respiratory infections and diseases preventable by immunization increased more slowly. The increasing trend in under-5-year-old mortality was more pronounced in instances when the mother derived her major income from sources other than farming and in larger households.

Approximately 40,000 children from 75 locations in seven districts in two ecological settings (lowland and hills) took part in the study and were randomly allocated to intervention cohorts or a control group. At 24 months after the implementation of the project the reduction of risk for xerophthalmia was greater among children whose mothers were able to identify vitamin-A-rich foods (relative risk (RR) = 0.25; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.10-0.62) than among the children who received mega-dose capsules (RR = 0.59; 95% CI = 0.41-0.84). The risk of mortality at 2 years was reduced for both the nutrition education (RR = 0.64; 95% Cl = 0.48-0.86) and capsule distribution (RR = 0.57; 95% CI = 0.42-0.77) cohorts. The nutrition education programme was, however, more expensive to deliver than the capsule distribution programme. High rates of participation for children in the supplementation programme were achieved quickly. The nutrition education messages also spread rapidly throughout the study population (regardless of intervention cohort assignment). Practices, however, were slower to change. In communities where maternal literacy was low and channels of communication were limited the capsule distribution programme appeared to be more economical. However, there are economies of scale for nationwide education programmes that do not exist for capsule distribution programmes. Although nutrition education provides economies of scale and the promise of long-term sustainability, a comprehensive national programme requires both dietary supplementation and nutrition education components.
The effectiveness of two approaches to vitamin A deficiency prevention--nutrition education and mega-dose capsule distribution--was compared in a 3-year study involving almost 40,000 children 6 months to 10 years of age from seven ecologically diverse districts in Nepal. The nutrition education program promoted increased intake of vitamin A-rich foods during the dry season, serving wild greens, and primary health care service utilization. At baseline, 44.9% of the study villages did not have any cases of Bitot's spots; by the third year, 65.5% were free of this sign of vitamin A deficiency. 85% of community risk variation was explained by agricultural patterns, market food availability, household income, maternal literacy, sanitation, and the village's average nutritional status. At 12 months, capsule distribution had reduced the risk of new Bitot's spots by 55% (relative risk (RR), 0.45; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.33-0.60); however, its impact had declined by 24 months and was non-significant at 36 months. At 24 months, the reduction of risk for xerophthalmia was greatest among children whose mothers were able to identify vitamin A-rich foods (RR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.10-0.62) and were literate (RR, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.01-0.42). By 24 months, child mortality risk had declined in both the nutrition education (RR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.48-0.86) and capsule distribution (RR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.42-0.77) groups. Although the effects of both programs were similar, the capsule program achieved higher coverage rates at a lower cost while the educational intervention provided economies of scale and potential for long-term sustainability.

Findings are based on the 1990-93 West Berlin Aging Survey among a probability sample of persons aged 70-105 years and intensive interviews. The final sample includes 477 persons, who were grouped as an older cohort (born during 1887-1900), a middle cohort (born during 1901-10), and a younger cohort (born during 191-22). This paper gives a description of the marital and migration histories, the effects of early divorce and widowhood on resources and social integration, and an analysis of the effects of region of birth and experience with fleeing or being expelled on resources and social adjustment. Social integration is measured by participation outside the home in a variety of activities. Fifteen different combinations of marriage, widowhood, and divorce were identified. Almost no one married more than twice, and almost all married at least once. 32% of men's first marriages still existed at the time of the interview. Only 5% of women's first marriages did. More than 50% of men's first marriages still existed when men reached the age of 70 years, and only 25% of the women's did. 70% of men of the oldest cohort, 49% of the middle cohort, and 55% of the youngest cohort were still in first marriages at the age of 70 years. Some of the cohort differences are attributed to mortality differences. 50% of women in first marriages lost a spouse due to death before the age of 70 years. Divorced women, who did not remarry, were economically the worst off. World War II (WWII) widows were closer to divorced women's economic status, and more recent widows were closer to unmarried women. Divorced women and WWII widows viewed their health more negatively.

In the heritable form, tumors are often bilateral and survivors have a greatly increased risk both for a second malignancy and for having children with Rb. Familial patterns of both cancer and birth defects are poorly understood in families with a heritable cancer, and little is known of the ways that a heritable cancer affects the lives of long-term survivors. To find out more about these and other issues in the lives of long-term survivors of childhood and adolescent cancer, we interviewed 56 adult survivors of retinoblastoma (15 with the heritable form) and 84 brothers and sisters as controls, who formed part of a large retrospective cohort study. Rb survivors were interviewed between 1980 and 1983, when they were 30 years old on average. Types of employment and health problems did not differ between survivors and controls, regardless of sight, but the income of blind survivors was considerably less than that of partially sighted survivors. Despite similar marriage rates, fewer survivors than controls reported a pregnancy (RR = 0.45; 95% CI; 0.24-0.83 for both sexes combined). Parents of children with heritable Rb seemed more likely to have had cancer than parents in families with nonheritable Rb (P = 0.06), and mothers were more likely than fathers to be affected (P = 0.01). This small series suggests that having retinoblastoma may have many long-term consequences, reaching beyond genetic and physical effects to touch family life and income attainment and the health of other family members.

The solutions to this problem vary with the cultural context. Declines in the spousal age difference and increases in dowry payments (India) and polygamy (Africa) are two adjustments to a disequilibrium in the marriage market. We hypothesize that in Brazil the marriage market finds its balance by ""recycling"" men through highly unstable informal unions. Using census and 1984 survey data, we establish the relationship between a marriage squeeze and the increase in informal marriage. Census data and a competing-risks analysis of marriage choice provide evidence that a marriage squeeze has affected both the chances of marrying at all and the type of marriage entered.
The competing risks logistic model of the likelihood of entering a formal or informal union or staying single in Brazil reveals that race has a strong effect on marriage choice and marriage, only when region of residence is not included in the model. Blacks are more likely than Whites to enter informal unions. Asians are less likely to enter informal unions. Women in the northeast are less likely to enter formal marriages and more likely to enter informal unions than remaining single. Women in the south are more likely to enter formal marriages. Chances of entering an informal union are increased with urban residence and younger age. Increased schooling decreases the likelihood of entering a formal or informal union. Higher unearned income increases the likelihood of entering an informal union. After age 25 age becomes important in influencing the effects on entering informal and formal unions. Women over the age of 25 years and under the age of 35-39 years are less likely to enter formal unions and more likely to enter informal unions. Women over the age of 35-39 years are less likely to enter informal unions. The proportion of women working decreases the likelihood of formal marriage compared to remaining single and increases the likelihood of consensual unions. A greater supply of men increases the chances of entering a formal marriage rather than remaining single. The supply of men has no effect on remaining single compared to entering an informal union. Census data for 1980 on state level sex ratios and rates of divorced males per ever married women reveal that as the pool of marriageable men declines, it is easier for women to marry, stay married, and to remarry. It is more difficult for men to do so. The interpretation of findings is that Brazil's solution to the marriage squeeze is the recycling of marriage partners and an increase in informal unions. Other non-Latin countries exhibit different responses to the marriage squeeze, such as increased rates of polygyny or reduced spousal age differences.",Demographic imbalances can impact marriage patterns.,Impact of marriage squeeze on marriage patterns in Brazil.,Analysis of census and survey data to assess marriage patterns in Brazil.,Marriage squeeze led to increased informal unions and changes in marriage choices.,Findings specific to Brazil and may not generalize to other regions.

The former Soviet Republics in Europe as well as Georgia and Armenia had completed or almost completed their demographic transition before October 1991. Other Central Asian republics experienced reduced mortality, but, despite rapid declines, fertility is still above replacement level (at 3-4 children per woman). The economic and social dislocation of the breakup of the republics has hastened fertility decline. The annual population growth rate of the USSR in the mid-1980s was 0.9%; this rate declined to 0.4% in 1991, and the decline has continued. The 1991 population of the USSR was 289.1 million. Between 1989 and 1991, the crude birth rate was 18/1000 population, and the crude death rate was 10/1000. The net migration rate of -4/1000 helped to reduce growth. Total fertility in the USSR was 2.3 children in 1990. In Russia, fertility declined from 1.9 in 1990 to 1.4 in 1993. The preferred family size in Russia was 1.9 in 1990 and 1.5 in 1993. This decline occurred due to lack of confidence in the economy and insufficient income. Only 19% of women used contraception in 1990. Marriages declined after 1990. Age pyramids were similar in the republics in that there was a narrowing in the proportion aged 45-49 years, and the male population aged over 65 years was diminished, due to the effect of World War II. The cohort of those aged 20-24 years in 1992 was very small due to the small parental birth cohort. The differences in the republics was characterized as broad-based in the younger ages because of high fertility. The number of childbearing women will remain large. Life expectancy has been 70 years since the 1950s and has declined in some republics due to substandard health care, lack of job safety measures, and alcoholism. Some republics experienced increased life expectancy, but, after 1991, mortality increased. Tajikistan had the highest infant mortality of 47/1000 live births in 1993.

To address the concerns of policy makers within the US Department of Veterans' Affairs (VA), data on elderly US male veterans and non-veterans from the Longitudinal Survey on Aging in 1984, 1986, 1988, and 1990 were used in a prospective study. Health status or well-being was assessed through changes over time in ADL status, according to the following five categories; (I) the presence of no ADL dependence and not developing a dependence between survey periods, (II) no change in ADL dependence between survey periods, (III) an increase in ADL dependence status between survey periods, (IV) a decrease in ADL dependence between survey periods, and (V) the occurrence of death between survey periods. Using a polytomous logistic regression model, these five categories were assessed in relation to a set of variables representing social, health-care utilization, and socioeconomic characteristics. The estimated coefficients from the model indicate that family income, having worked in the last 12 months, having an increase or no change in levels of physical activity in the past 12 months and the presence of Medicare coverage are inversely associated with moving, over time, into a lower state of health status or well-being. The prior existence of an ADL limitation, the number of doctor and hospital visits in the past 12 months, level of education, having been widowed in the past 12 months and veteran status were all proportionally associated with the likelihood of moving into a lower state of health status or well-being. These findings lead to the conclusion that being a veteran in the US does make a difference in regard to moving into various states of health status or well-being. This difference is supported by the estimated coefficient for veteran status being significant at a p value of 0.01 and through an evaluation of the estimated transition likelihood, controlling for veteran status. Veterans are less likely to die than their non-veteran counterparts, but have a greater likelihood of transition into levels of ADL dependence. Similarly, given the existence of a prior ADL limitation, over time, veterans are less likely to die, but more likely to move into a state of increased ADL limitations.",Veteran status may impact health outcomes.,Health status changes over time in elderly male veterans vs. non-veterans.,Prospective study using longitudinal survey data to assess health changes in elderly male veterans.,Veteran status was associated with different health transitions over time compared to non-veterans.,Study focused on male veterans and may not generalize to female veterans or non-veterans.

No treatment of any kind was sought outside the home for 30 (22%) of the children who died from natural causes, and for 59 (42%) others only a traditional healer or other source of non-western medical advice was consulted. Whether or not a mother sought western medical care was strongly associated with the age of the child, the duration of the terminal illness, the previous attendance of the mother at a community-based maternal-and-child-health facility, and the mother's response to a prospectively asked question about what care should be sought for a hypothetical 1-month-old baby with signs of severe pneumonia. Household income, maternal age, and education, and distance between home and government health post were not associated with whether or not western medical care was sought.
Between July 1991 and December 1992, in Indramaya, West Java, Indonesia, trained community workers administered a questionnaire to mothers who experienced a death of a child under 5 years old during the study period (total deaths, 141) to study patterns of seeking care for gravely ill infants and children. The workers interviewed most mothers within 7 days of the child death. During this time, the neonatal mortality rate was 26.7, postneonatal mortality was 47.6, overall infant mortality was 74.3, and overall under-5 mortality was 80.7. Trauma was responsible for 2 deaths. The remaining causes of death were illness. Among these, 46% took place within the first 59 days of life. Duration of terminal illness varied from a few hours to more than 2 weeks. Families sought either just care from Western medical practitioner or a Western medical practitioner and a traditional healer in 36% of deaths due to illness. They sought a traditional healer and/or other people not trained in Western medicine in 42.4% of cases. They did not seek any care in the e remaining 21.6% of cases. 77% of the mothers of these cases believed the child's death was God's will.

A total of 719 patients were entered in the study, 704 of whom were either black or white men. Blacks were found to have a significantly lower socioeconomic status than whites as measured by marital and educational status, occupation, income, housing, and number of individuals residing in household. Blacks had a significantly lower frequency of prior tumor resection and a significantly increased frequency of mediastinal lymph node involvement and of metastasis than whites. Trends existed toward a shorter time interval from original diagnosis to entry and a lower frequency of prior radiation therapy among blacks in comparison with whites at the time of entry to the study. However, no differences in intensity of treatment or follow-up, time to progression, response to treatment, or overall survival (measured from entry to the study to death) were observed for blacks vs whites.
Lung and colon cancer are not necessarily more aggressive diseases in blacks than in whites. Based on a comparison of these data with those reported from other practice settings, we postulate that lung and colon cancer outcomes may be similar among black and white patients who receive equal access to comparable medical care in spite of socioeconomic differences. Findings suggest that future studies might focus profitably on racial factors that may exist at the time of patient entry to the health care system.",Shorter survival of blacks than whites with lung and colon cancer.,Are genetic or socioeconomic factors responsible for the survival disparity between black and white patients with lung and colon cancer?,"Prospective collection of biological and socioeconomic data from patients with advanced lung and colon cancer, followed up to death.",No survival differences between black and white patients when receiving equal access to comparable medical care.,"Limited to patients within the Department of Veterans Affairs hospital system, may not generalize to broader populations."

By first birthday children of normal nutrition grade were reduced to one fourth and numbers in Grade II and III malnutrition doubled. This deterioration in nutritional status was probably due to high morbidity, i.e., gastrointestinal, respiratory infections, etc. The skull circumference was 43 cm at the age of one year, being lower by 3 cm than the average size. Children having Grades II and III malnutrition showed poor development in all the areas of behavior, i.e., motor, adaptive, language and personal social. Besides malnutrition, environmental factors like mother's involvement in teaching, encouraging the child, talking to him or being within the visual range; the parental education, their caste and the child's birth order contributed significantly to the development of the child during infancy.
The goal of this study was to better understand the risk of developing malnutrition, the age of onset and its severity, and common morbidities and causes of mortality. The aim was also to determine whether malnutrition or other behavioral factors affected behavior development. A cohort of 625 children born between November 1981 and March 1983 from 10 rural villages in KV Block, Varanasi, India, was registered and followed for 1 year. Data from 224 children, who provided continuous data for at least 4 age points out of 5, was analyzed. Information was obtained on morbidity, physical growth, and behavior based on Gesell's development schedule. Children were grouped based on degrees of malnutrition (weight-for-age schedule of the Indian Academy of Pediatrics) at 4, 16, 28, and 52 weeks. Some Caldwell Home Inventory items and other environmental and socioeconomic measures were obtained by questionnaire. The village population mirrored the characteristics of the 120,000 rural population in the surrounding 112 villages covering 147 sq. miles. The male/female ratio was 10009:39. Infant mortality rates were 133/1000 live births; neonatal mortality rates were 64/1000 live births. 26% have low birth weight (2500 g). 13% of preschool children suffer from severe malnutrition and 50% from mild malnutrition. 79.4% of mothers and 21.2% of fathers were illiterate. 56% had an income of less than Rs.100/year/capita. The findings showed that the height and weight of study children declined from the 20th centile at 3 months to the 3rd centile after 6 months. By 1 year, those children with normal nutrition were reduced by 25% and the numbers of children with Grade II and III malnutrition doubled. Underfeeding as well as high morbidity may be responsible for the deterioration. The skull circumference was 3 cm smaller than the average of 43 cm at 1 year of age.

In the crude analyses, maternal education was associated with perinatal and infant mortality, hospital admissions in the first 20 months of life and the three nutritional indicators (length-for-age, weight-for-age and weight-for-length) at mean age 20 months. After adjustment for confounding, the apparent associations with outcomes in early infancy--birthweight and perinatal mortality--were no longer present, while that with infant mortality persisted despite being reduced. Strong associations remained with later outcomes including hospital admissions, length-for-age and weight-for-age at mean age 20 months. Among infants born to women with little or no schooling, deaths due to diarrhoea, pneumonia and other infectious diseases were particularly common. These findings support the hypothesis that maternal education has an effect on child health which is partly independent from that of other socioeconomic factors; they also suggest that maternal care is more important than the biological characteristics of the mothers since stronger effects were observed for the late (postneonatal mortality, hospital admissions and nutritional status) than for the early (birthweight, perinatal mortality) outcomes.",Association between maternal education and child health outcomes.,How does maternal education influence child health outcomes while considering other socioeconomic factors?,"Population-based cohort study of Brazilian children, controlling for family income and husband's education.","Maternal education associated with perinatal and infant mortality, hospital admissions, and nutritional indicators.","Focused on a specific Brazilian population, findings may not apply to other regions or countries."

Mortality rates among people 25-37 yr of age from the Allegheny County IDDM Registry were over two times greater than the rates observed from the Finland IDDM Registry. Applying the Finnish rate to the structure of the IDDM population from Allegheny County suggests that about one-half of the deaths in the Allegheny County cohort may be theoretically preventable. Most deaths that might be avoided appear to be caused by the acute complications of diabetes. Deaths from acute-related causes were higher (as a proportion of all deaths) in the Allegheny County cohort than in Finland (46.2 vs. 33.3%). There is some indication that barriers to health care may be present among individuals with IDDM in the United States. Individuals without health insurance from the Children's Hospital IDDM Registry in Pittsburgh had fewer physician visits than those with insurance. Even for those with insurance, out-of-pocket health-care expenses were significant. People with lower household incomes (less than $20,000) spent more, as a percentage of their income, on medical supplies than those with higher incomes and may have been less likely to monitor blood glucose levels and visit an eye doctor because of it. These findings suggest that health system barriers, such as the access to care and the financial burden of diabetes care, in the United States may be affecting the health of adults with IDDM. Further investigation is needed to clarify the extent of barriers to care in IDDM and their contribution to adverse health outcomes.",Disparities in mortality rates among individuals with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.,What factors contribute to higher mortality rates in individuals with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in different regions?,"Comparison of mortality rates between Finland and Allegheny County IDDM registries, assessing barriers to healthcare access.",Higher mortality rates in Allegheny County; barriers to healthcare access may contribute to adverse outcomes.,"Focused on specific regions, findings may not generalize to broader populations."

Since 25.6 percent of the subjects were Black, it was possible to examine race-related changes in health, function, and socioeconomic status over nine years, as well as differences in rates of institutionalization and mortality. Aging urban Blacks continue to experience major social disadvantages, especially in education and income. After age 74, although Blacks probably experience more favorable mortality rates and less institutionalization, they consider themselves less healthy and are more likely to develop diabetes, hypertension, and glaucoma. Although Blacks rate their own mental health lower, this difference is not supported by other measures. Functionally, elderly Whites are more likely to be dependent in certain activities of daily living. The findings are consistent with the previously observed mortality crossover; predictors of mortality are identified but do not differ by race. Lower institutionalization rates among older Blacks may be partly explained by different living patterns, poverty, and a higher proportion of males among surviving Blacks.","Race-related changes in health, function, and socioeconomic status in elderly urban residents.","How do race-related factors influence health, function, and socioeconomic status changes in elderly urban residents?","Population-based cohort study of urban residents aged 65 and over, analyzing race-related differences in health and socioeconomic status.","Blacks experience major social disadvantages, higher rates of certain health conditions, and lower institutionalization rates.","Focused on urban residents, findings may not generalize to rural populations or other regions."

Black infants served by civilian medical care had approximately twice the neonatal mortality of white infants; however, black infants born in the military hospital had a neonatal mortality rate comparable to white infants. Controlling for marital status, age, parity, and income status did not appreciably change these patterns.

Another study objective was to investigate the robustness of the findings of Trussell et al. (1985) by comparing the findings of this study with theirs. The hazard rate of conception for the jth fecundable spell of the ith woman, hij, is determined by duration dependence, tij, measured by the waiting time to conception; unmeasured heterogeneity (HETi; the time-invariant variables, Yi (race, cohort, education, age at marriage); and time-varying variables, Xij (age, parity, opportunity cost, income, child mortality, child sex composition). In this study, all the time-varying variables were constant over a spell. An asymptotic X2 test for the equality of constant hazard rates across birth orders, allowing time-invariant variables and heterogeneity, showed the importance of time-varying variables and duration dependence. Under the assumption of fixed effects heterogeneity and the Weibull distribution for the duration of waiting time to conception, the empirical results revealed a negative parity effect, a negative impact from male children, and a positive effect from child mortality on the hazard rate of conception. The estimates of step functions for the hazard rate of conception showed parity-dependent fertility control, evidence of heterogeneity, and the possibility of nonmonotonic duration dependence. In a hazard rate model with piecewise-linear-segment duration dependence, the socioeconomic variables such as cohort, child mortality, income, and race had significant effects, after controlling for the length of the preceding birth. The duration dependence was consistant with the common finding, i.e., first increasing and then decreasing at a slow rate.

Wives with post-primary education had the lowest number of children (1.97); those with a primary education had more children on average (5.53) than those with no schooling (3.49). Multiple regression analysis indicated a statistically significant contribution to fertility by 4 variables: age, age at marriage, couple communication, and infant-child mortality. Discussion of family planning was a consequence of high fertility. The analysis failed to indicate a trend toward smaller family size. Even women in the youngest age group (15-24 years) expressed adherence to traditional reproductive values. 42% of respondents saw nothing wrong with having large numbers of children. 71% agreed that large family size represents a burden, especially in terms of education. This suggest that the introduction of compulsory free education and better housing facilities could serve to increase fertility. It is concluded that reduction in population growth in Kenya will require modification of existing reproductive values.",Factors influencing mortality in a rural Javanese village.,What factors contribute to mortality in children born in a rural Javanese village?,"Study of child mortality in a rural Javanese village, assessing maternal age, education, and other socioeconomic factors.","Maternal age, education, and access to resources influenced child mortality rates.","Focused on a specific rural population, findings may not generalize to urban or other rural settings."

Lower risk of death was associated with younger maternal age, maternal schooling, ownership of a well, smaller sibship, longer gap between child and next oldest sibling and, in particular, with good nutritional status. Diarrhoea, pneumonia and immunizable diseases accounted for over half the deaths, with malnutrition contributing to most. A primary health care programme focusing on malnutrition, immunization and early treatment for diarrhoea and pneumonia could reduce mortality by half or more in this population.
A study, initiated in May 1976, was conducted in the rural village of Ngaglik located 15 km north of Yogyakarta city, Indonesia in an attempt to provide definitive information on child mortality. 510 mothers who gave birth between January 1, 1976 and March 31, 1977 were followed. Each woman was interviewed monthly in her home from May 1976 through July 1978 when information on women's activities, diet, illness, and fertility was obtained. Once in every 35 days each neighborhood was visited by a specially trained anthropometric team who carried out body measurements on each woman and her child with accurate and standardized instruments. Measurements included body weight; height, head, arm, and chest circumferences; and skinfold thickness. A detailed history of illness during the past month and treatment response was recorded for each child and mother. Each death was reported and a visit was made immediately to the family of the deceased child. An open-ended interview was conducted, covering the terminal illness, preceding symptoms, treatment efforts, and presumed cause of death. Data on each deceased child were hand tabulated and compared with the entire cohort of 458 survivors. A comparison group of children or ""controls"" was established. 2 age matched surviving children were chosen and matched for village, economic indicators, maternal education level, and maternal age. Analysis of these 104 survivors was carried out as a control group for comparison with the 52 deceased children. There was a significant relationship between maternal age and mortality, the mortality rate more than doubling for births to mothers over age 30, i.e., 6.8% in those mothers aged 15-29 and 14.7% for children with mothers aged 30 and older. Educational level of the mother indicated a higher mortality among children whose mothers had never attended school, i.e., 13.8% compared to 8.4% for those with some education. This relationship was not statistically significant. Absence of a drinking water well, close child spacing, and size of sibship were also associated with increased risk of dying. Family economic status failed to demonstrate the expected direct correlation with risk of death, the highest rates being found in the middle income and medium land holding groups. The causes of death found were preventable infections, readily treated infections, and undernutrition. Some 90% of the postneonatal deaths need not have occurred had even the most basic of primary health services been provided for these families. Effective family planning programs aimed at higher parity, older mothers, and increased child spacing could reduce some of the risk factors.",,,,,

Statistics Canada applied the method to the 1971 Canadian census to exploit the possibilities and published a bulletin with 6 tables, each of which showed currently married women in 5-year cohorts, the ratio of own children/1000 women, and results according to the birthplace of the woman, the duration of marriage, and educational level, for such factors as the religion, ethnic origin, employment status, educational level, and occupation of the spouse. The most evident biases in the method itself result from census imperfections, mortality which removes mothers and children from observation before the census date, the exclusion of children not living with their mothers, and age misstatement. However, the sample used by Statistics Canada was very highly selected and thus not representative of the general population: women not currently in their 1st marriage, those who had not had a live birth, and women of foreign origin for example were excluded. The selectivity for the various excluding factors varies by age, to a degree which is indeterminable given the data limitations. The method would be more useful in Canada if, in addition to using a more inclusive sample, all women over 15 were questioned about fertility in the census, regardless of marital status, and if a distinction were made between legal and de facto marriage.",,,,,

Bureau of the Census,Curr Popul Rep Popul Charact,1980,1980/05/01,,,,"This document provides a profile of the U.S. population in 1979 in terms of: 1) population, size, growth, and distribution, and 2) the social, economic, and racial characteristics of the population. Trends during the 1970s are also noted. The total estimated population of the U.S. in 1979 was 221,719,000. The population increased by 0.9% in 1979 and this increase was slightly larger than the increase in 1978. The increase was due to a slight increase in immigration and a slightly higher birth rate. The birth rate increased from 15.3/1000 population in 1978 to 15.8/1000 population in 1979. The total fertility rate increased from 1800 to 1840/1000 women of childbearing age from 1978-1979. During the 1970s, the total fertility rate decreased 26% and the fertility rate for both blacks and whites declined. Between 1970-1979 the population under 14 years of age declined by 14%, the population 65 years of age or older increased by 24%, and the cohort of 25-34-year-olds increased by 39%. In 1979, 49% of the women, aged 20-24, were never married. In 1960 the respective proportion was 28%. From 1970-1979, the proportion of children under the age of 18 who lived with a single parent increased from 12% to 19%. 91% lived with their mothers in 1979; however, the proportion of those living with their fathers increased over the past year. During the 1970s nursery school attendance increased 71% and about 85% of all young adults completed 12 years of education. In 1979 college enrollment was higher for women than for men due primarily to the high enrollment of older women. The annual rate of population growth in non-metropolitan areas was 1.18% and in metropolitan areas it was 0.73% during 1970-1978. Central cities experienced an annual decline of 0.4% during the 1970s due primarily to out-migration of whites. Northeast and north central regions experienced out-migration and the southern and western regions experienced in-migration. During the 1970s the labor force grew by 24% while the population of 16-year-olds grew by 18%. In 1979, 42% of the labor force was made up by women and 10% by teenagers. Median family income was $17,640 in 1978. The median income for full time workers was $9640 for women and $16,000 for men. 9% of the whites, 31% of the blacks, and 22% of persons of Spanish origin lived at or below the poverty level in 1978. In 1979 the proportion of blacks and of persons of Spanish origin in the noninstitutionalized civilian population was respectively 11.6% and 5.6%.

12335579,Evolution of fertility and mortality,,Popul Bull. 1978 Apr;33(2):8-16.,,Popul Bull,1978,1978/04/01,,,,"Historical and current fertility trends in both Quebec and Canada as a whole are surveyed. While fertility among French Canadians was higher than that in neighboring provinces until the mid-20th century, in 1968 Quebec's crude birthrate was the lowest in Canada, and in 1972 it was 13.8 vs. 15.9 (the national birthrate). This reversal is explained in terms of the demographic transition theory, the declining influence of organized religion, and new opportunities for social mobility for minority groups. The birthrate throughout Canada is also declining. Although recent cohort studies are incomplete because women have not yet finished their reproductive years, it appears that completed family size will be lower than at any time in Canadian history. The period total fertility rate indicates an average family size of 1.8 children in 1976, but it is unclear whether this represents an actual reduction in family size or the postponement of childbearing. The sharpest fertility decline has been among women aged 35-49, but peak fertility rates have shifted from the 20-24 age group to those aged 25-29. Fertility is negatively related to education, and the lowest fertility is found among the intermediate income groups. Since the 1969 lifting of the ban on contraceptive sales and advertising, family planning activities have been stepped up. Also removed was the total ban on abortion. In 1975 there were 14.9 therapeutic abortions per 100 live births, but it has been charged that abortion standards are being applied inequitably from hospital to hospital.",Fertility trends in Quebec and Canada,How have fertility rates changed in Quebec and Canada?,"Historical analysis of fertility data, demographic transition theory","Declining fertility rates, shift in peak fertility age group, impact of education and income on fertility","Incomplete cohort studies, potential biases in abortion standards"

The specific topics include a monograph on fertility, another on marriage and divorce, and one on social and economic factors in mortality, all of which are of obvious demographic interest. The core of the development of the monographs dealing with the disease topics, and accidents, homicide, and suicide, is a tabulation program involving specific and age-adjusted death rates based upon the deaths in the United States for the three year period 1959-61 and the 1960 census of population. The program called for a set of standard tabulations common to each monograph and also a set of special tabulations tailored to meet the particular needs for each topic as specified by its authors. This wealth of demographic detail regarding mortality in the United States during 1959-61 fills only one aspect of its health picture. To fill out the health picture, use is being made of the great volume of morbidity data out of the National Health Interview and Examination Surveys and a wide variety of other specialized surveys. In all of these, the findings are invariably described in terms of the demographic characteristics of age and sex, and frequently in terms of such social-economic variables as education, income, work status, and occupational class.A large part of the content of the monograph on social and economic factors in mortality will come out of available results of the 1960 census-death certificate matching study at the University of Chicago. One important feature of this monograph, not contained in the Chicago study, is a regression and correlation analysis of total mortality in 202 Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas in relation to a large number of social, economic, and climatic factors. Among the features in the monograph on fertility are chapters on the medical and biological characteristics of births, fecundity and family planning, and an analysis of cohort fertility trends. The monograph on marriage and divorce will make use of the detailed tabulations from the 1960 census on marital status in relation to education, race, parentage, earnings and other classifications of individuals and of husband and wife in married couples. It will also contain a matching study of divorce records in certain states for a short period before the census of 1960 with the returns in the census. The project is supported by a grant from the United States Public Health Service (CH 00075; formerly RG 08262).
